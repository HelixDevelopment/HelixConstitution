# scheduled-work-engine — DESIGN

**Revision:** 1
**Last modified:** 2026-07-02T00:00:00Z

## 1. Goal & scope

Backing infrastructure that gives the `REMINDER` / `BACKGROUND` action-prefix
(§11.4.140) real teeth: a **decoupled, project-agnostic** (§11.4.28) service that
tracks scheduled/background work items so an autonomous agent can, when a
REMINDER fires, query for work whose outcome is **not yet confirmed** and
re-verify it before reporting done (§11.4.6 no-guessing, §11.4.108
verify-before-report). No ATMOSphere/consumer-specific data is hardcoded; all
configuration is via env/flags (§11.4.28).

## 2. Architecture

```
cmd/scheduled-work            subcommands: serve | mcp-stdio | acp-stdio | version
  └─ internal/server          gin.Engine (REST + POST /mcp) + brotli middleware + TLS
  └─ internal/mcp             MCP JSON-RPC 2.0 dispatcher (shared by HTTP + stdio)
  └─ internal/acp             newline-delimited JSON-RPC stdio loop (MCP-stdio + ACP-equiv)
  └─ internal/store           JSON-file store (mutex + atomic write), the data model
```

One `gin.Engine` implements `http.Handler`, so it is served **identically** over
HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 (TCP TLS) and HTTP/3 (QUIC UDP). One MCP dispatcher backs the
HTTP `/mcp` endpoint AND the stdio transports — a single tool implementation,
three transports.

### Current libraries (researched — §11.4.8/§11.4.99, verified 2026-07-02)

- `github.com/quic-go/quic-go` **v0.60.0** — `http3.Server{Handler,TLSConfig}`
  (`ListenAndServe` / `Serve(net.PacketConn)`) for the server; `http3.Transport`
  (an `http.RoundTripper`) for the client. gin does not serve HTTP/3 natively, so
  the `gin.Engine` is wrapped as the `http.Handler` behind `http3.Server`
  (confirmed against the vendored source, not assumed).
- `github.com/andybalholm/brotli` **v1.2.2** — `brotli.NewWriterLevel`; note it has
  no `WriteString` (the gin `ResponseWriter` `WriteString` is implemented via
  `Write([]byte(s))`).
- `github.com/gin-gonic/gin` (latest) — router.
- `github.com/google/uuid` — item ids.

Graceful fallback: `serve` starts a TCP TLS `http.Server` (h1/h2) AND the UDP
`http3.Server`; every h1/h2 response advertises the h3 alt-svc via
`SetQUICHeaders`, so clients upgrade to HTTP/3 when able. `SWQ_H3=0` runs h1/h2
only.

## 3. Store choice — JSON file (justification, §11.4.6)

A reminder / scheduled-work queue is a **low-write-volume** workload. Options:
- **SQLite (mattn/go-sqlite3)** — needs CGO, complicating static/cross builds.
- **BoltDB** — an extra module dependency for a tiny dataset.
- **JSON file (chosen)** — zero CGO, zero extra module, trivially portable across
  every supported platform (§11.4.81), human-inspectable for debugging.

Durability: a `sync.RWMutex` serialises all access; writes go through
write-temp-`fsync`-rename (atomic replace), so a crash never leaves a torn file.
`Open` on a corrupt file returns an error rather than silently dropping data
(§11.4.6). The `TestConcurrentCreate` test drives 50 concurrent creates through
the mutex with zero lost writes; `go test -race` is clean.

## 4. ACP surface — honesty note (§11.4.6 / §11.4.99)

"ACP" (Agent Client Protocol, agentclientprotocol.com) is an emerging
JSON-RPC-2.0-over-stdio protocol whose full session / prompt-turn model targets
interactive coding **agents**, not a stateless work-queue service. Implementing
the complete ACP agent lifecycle here would invent behaviour that does not fit
this service. Instead `internal/acp` exposes the **same** newline-delimited
JSON-RPC-2.0-over-stdio transport ACP uses, dispatching to the identical tool set
as the MCP surface. It is therefore an **ACP-EQUIVALENT** adapter, clearly
labelled in source — not a claim of full ACP-agent conformance. This is stated as
a fact, not hidden behind a green test.

## 5. Anti-bluff test coverage (§11.4 / §11.4.27 / §1.1)

- **Unit** (`internal/store`, `internal/mcp`) — model, lifecycle, derived
  `overdue`, needs-verification, persistence round-trip, invalid-input rejection,
  concurrency; MCP initialize / tools-list / tools-call / error paths.
- **Integration** (`test/`, no mocks — §11.4.27) — boots the REAL `http3.Server`
  on an ephemeral UDP port and round-trips create→list→mark-done→verify over
  **HTTP/3** (asserts `resp.Proto == "HTTP/3.0"`) with **brotli**
  (asserts `Content-Encoding: br` and decodes it); plus the MCP-over-HTTP/3
  endpoint.
- **§1.1 paired mutation** (`test/meta_mutation.sh`) — breaks the mark-done
  handler at source, asserts the suite goes RED, restores, asserts GREEN. Proves
  the suite is not a bluff gate.
- **Live smoke** (`test/live_smoke.sh`) — boots the built binary and confirms the
  full lifecycle over REST-TLS + MCP-stdio, capturing the transcript under
  `qa-results/<ts>/`.

Honest boundary: brotli-over-HTTP/3 is asserted programmatically in the Go
integration test (a real h3 client); the `curl` live smoke uses the h1/h2
fallback of the same engine because curl does not speak HTTP/3 to a self-signed
cert here.

## 6. Consumer wiring

- MCP registration: `constitution/mcp/scheduled-work-mcp.json`.
- Claude Code plugin: `constitution/plugins/scheduled-work/` (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` +
  `.mcp.json` + `build.sh`).
- Skill: `constitution/skills/scheduled-work-queue/` (`skill.md` + `register.sh`).

## 7. Proposed governance-anchor handoff (for the conductor — NOT applied here)

Per the task's file-scope isolation, this component does NOT edit Constitution.md
or any carrier. If the operator/conductor wishes to make this infrastructure a
mandated capability, the following anchor text is PROPOSED for integration by the
conductor (classification: universal, §11.4.17):

> **§11.4.NNN — Scheduled-work / reminder verify-before-report backing service.**
> The `REMINDER` / `BACKGROUND` action-prefix (§11.4.140) MUST be backed by a
> durable scheduled-work queue (the `scheduled-work-engine`) so that deferred /
> background work is recorded with a lifecycle status, and a REMINDER MUST query
> `list_needs_verification` (`blocked`/`uncertain`/`overdue`) and re-confirm each
> item's real outcome with captured evidence (§11.4.5/§11.4.69) BEFORE the agent
> reports it done (§11.4.6/§11.4.108) — never marking an item done on assumption.
> The queue is decoupled + project-agnostic (§11.4.28), consumed by reference,
> and the loop done-condition (§11.4.87/§11.4.126) MUST NOT read satisfied while
> any tracked item is non-terminal. Recommended gate
> `CM-SCHEDULED-WORK-VERIFY-BEFORE-DONE` + paired §1.1 mutation. Composes
> §11.4.6/§11.4.28/§11.4.108/§11.4.116/§11.4.126/§11.4.140.
