# cm_unreferenced_gate_bound_or_retired.sh — CM-UNREFERENCED-GATE-BOUND-OR-RETIRED
# (FR-019 — a gate that exists on disk but is referenced by no seam must be
# either BOUND to a seam or RETIRED with evidence. Neither is not an option.)
#
# ── Purpose ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A gate file nobody invokes is not enforcement, it is a file. §11.4.227(A) is
# explicit that a PROSE CARRIER never counts as an implementation; a script
# that no seam reaches is the same failure one layer down — it looks like
# coverage in a directory listing and refuses nothing in practice.
#
# This sweep enumerates every gate under the gates dir and assigns each ONE
# disposition from a closed set. It REFUSES while any gate is UNBOUND.
#
# ── The binding mechanisms (closed set, first match wins) ───────────────────
#
#   BOUND-SEAM-LITERAL     the gate's basename appears on a NON-COMMENT line
#                          of a declared seam file (wiring_seam_files.tsv).
#
#   BOUND-DATA-DISPATCH    the gate's filename is reproduced by applying a
#                          declared dispatcher rule (wiring_data_dispatch.tsv)
#                          to a REAL row of that rule's data pack, AND the
#                          dispatcher is itself seam-bound.
#
#   BOUND-PAIRED-MUTATION  a `*_mutation_test.sh` whose paired gate exists.
#
#   DEFERRED-REGISTERED    the token has a row in the deferrals registry —
#                          owed debt against a tracked item, per §11.4.227(A).
#
#   RETIRED-CITED          the token has a row in the removals registry
#                          carrying a VALID §11.4.124 git-history citation.
#
#   UNBOUND                none of the above. The sweep REFUSES.
#
# ── Two mechanisms exist because a naive one manufactures 51 false findings ─
# §11.4.201(7)(a) — match STRUCTURE, not substring, and know the difference
# between a THING and a CARRIER that mentions it:
#
#   * A gate name inside a COMMENT is a carrier, not an invocation. Comment
#     lines are stripped before the literal scan.
#   * covenant_propagation_suite.sh never contains the names of the 51 gates
#     it runs — it CONSTRUCTS them from a data pack. A basename-only sweep
#     would report all 51 as unreferenced. That is why BOUND-DATA-DISPATCH
#     exists and why it mirrors the dispatcher's own derivation rather than
#     inventing a parallel one.
#
# ── Why mutation tests bind by PAIRING, not by seam reference ───────────────
# A `*_mutation_test.sh` is a §1.1 paired mutation. It is invoked by the
# meta-test that validates its gate, never from a seam — by construction.
# Demanding a seam reference for all 86 of them would be a mass false-positive
# refusal (§11.4.201(1)). What IS decidable, and what genuinely goes wrong, is
# an ORPHAN: a mutation test whose gate was deleted, left behind validating
# nothing. So the pairing check is the binding, and it fires on exactly that.
# Measured on this tree: 86 mutation tests, 86 paired, 0 orphans — the check
# yields no findings today and would fire on the first orphan (proven by
# fixture in the paired mutation test, so it is not vacuous).
#
# A gate's OWN binding is reported once, on the gate. A mutation test is not
# reported a second time for its gate's unboundness — one root cause, one
# finding.
#
# ── Honest boundaries (§11.4.6) ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# (1) REACHABILITY, NOT EXECUTION. A literal reference on a non-comment line
#     proves the gate's path is reached by executable code in the seam. It
#     does NOT prove the call executes on every run — a gate behind a false
#     conditional still counts here. Proving a gate has ever actually REFUSED
#     is the first-refusal evidence layer (FR-022), a different deliverable.
#     This gate does not claim it.
# (2) THE T001 NON-GATE EXCLUSION IS CURRENTLY A NO-OP, AND IS IMPLEMENTED
#     ANYWAY. The four registered non-gate entries (the three libs under
#     lib/ and the wrappers generator) do not match `cm_*.sh`, so excluding
#     them removes nothing today. It is implemented so a future lib named
#     `cm_*.sh` cannot silently become a finding — stated rather than
#     presented as if it were filtering something.
# (3) `manual-qa-handoff` HAS NO SEAM FILE on this tree. It is recorded as an
#     honest gap in wiring_seam_files.tsv, not pointed at a plausible file.
#
# ── Usage ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   cm_unreferenced_gate_bound_or_retired.sh [--root <dir>] [--gates-dir <dir>]
#         [--seams <tsv>] [--dispatch <tsv>] [--deferrals <tsv>]
#         [--removals <tsv>] [--result <tsv>] [--no-write]
#   cm_unreferenced_gate_bound_or_retired.sh --fingerprint
#   cm_unreferenced_gate_bound_or_retired.sh --selftest
#
#     --result   where the sweep result is written (FR-021's input).
#                Default <gates-dir>/wiring_sweep_result.tsv.
#     --no-write report only; do not write the result file.
#     --fingerprint  print the current tree-state fingerprint and exit 0.
#
# ── The result file and its fingerprint (so a stale result cannot pass) ─────
# The sweep writes its verdict, every per-gate disposition, and a fingerprint
# over EXACTLY the inputs it read: every enumerated gate file, every declared
# seam file, every data pack, and both registries. Change any of them and the
# fingerprint changes, so a result computed against an earlier tree cannot
# satisfy a later one. FR-021's precondition predicate
# (lib/wiring_sweep_precondition.sh) compares against this value.
#
# ── Exit codes (contracts/gate-verdict.md) ──────────────────────────────────
#   0 ALLOW  — every gate is bound, deferred, or cited-retired.
#   1 FAIL   — reserved; this gate's violations are refusals, see below.
#   2 REFUSE — at least one gate is UNBOUND, or an input was unreadable, or
#              the control needle came back blind. An UNBOUND gate is a
#              REFUSE and not a FAIL on purpose: the finding is that the
#              WIRING (the instrument) is missing, which is what a REFUSE
#              means — someone must fix the instrument, not the product.

# DECOYS that a naive implementation flags — a data-dispatched gate whose name
# appears nowhere (51 false findings if mishandled), an unreferenced paired
# mutation test (86 more), and a registered non-gate. A sweep that fires on
# those is the false-positive refusal this feature forbids; one that passes
# the golden-TRUE set is blind. Either fails the selftest.
