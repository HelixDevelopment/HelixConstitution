# cm_machine_evidence_at_every_gate_mutation_test.sh — §1.1 paired mutation
# test for cm_machine_evidence_at_every_gate.sh (§11.4.262(A)(B)(E) —
# CM-MACHINE-EVIDENCE-AT-EVERY-GATE).
#
# ── Purpose ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Proves the gate is genuinely load-bearing (§1.1): golden-good PASSes
# (proven across ALL FOUR legal §11.4.108 layers at once — the
# false-positive-guard proof that the layer-validator does not spuriously
# reject any legitimate layer value), each distinct violation class
# correctly FAILs with the right reason, restore PASSes again, and a
# second false-positive guard is exercised (a manifest declaring ZERO
# rows, and the total absence of a manifest, are both genuinely-vacuous
# states that MUST NOT be mis-flagged as defects — §11.4.201(1)). All work
# happens in a disposable mktemp -d scratch tree (§11.4.84 — never the
# real working tree).
#
# ── Sub-cases ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   T1  — golden-GOOD: all 4 legal §11.4.108 layers declared (SOURCE,
#         ARTIFACT, RUNTIME_ON_CLEAN_TARGET, USER_VISIBLE), each with an
#         existing non-empty evidence file whose declared sha256 matches
#         its real sha256 -> PASSES (proves the layer-validator accepts
#         every legitimate layer value, not just one).
#   T2  — mutation: one row's layer value is corrupted to an illegal token
#         -> FAILs reason=INVALID_LAYER.
#   T3  — restore -> PASSES again.
#   T4  — mutation: one row's declared evidence file is deleted ->
#         FAILs reason=EVIDENCE_MISSING.
#   T5  — restore.
#   T6  — mutation: one row's declared evidence file is truncated to
#         zero bytes -> FAILs reason=EVIDENCE_EMPTY.
#   T7  — restore.
#   T8  — mutation: one row's declared evidence file is tampered
#         (appended-to) after its sha256 was recorded, so the real hash
#         no longer matches the declared hash -> FAILs
#         reason=EVIDENCE_HASH_MISMATCH (the content-addressed tamper /
#         staleness detector per §11.4.207).
#   T9  — restore.
#   T10 — FALSE-POSITIVE GUARD (a): manifest exists but declares ZERO
#         rows (comment-only) -> MUST PASS (vacuous, §11.4.201(1)).
#   T11 — FALSE-POSITIVE GUARD (b): manifest file does not exist at all
#         -> MUST PASS (vacuous, §11.4.201(1)).
#   T12 — restore to golden-GOOD -> PASSES again (gate not stuck).
#
# ── Usage ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   cm_machine_evidence_at_every_gate_mutation_test.sh
#
# ── Exit codes ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   0 — every sub-case behaved as required (gate is genuinely load-bearing).
#   1 — at least one sub-case behaved incorrectly (gate is decoration or broken).
#
# Classification: universal (§11.4.17).
