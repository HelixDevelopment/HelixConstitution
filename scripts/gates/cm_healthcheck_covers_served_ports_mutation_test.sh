# cm_healthcheck_covers_served_ports_mutation_test.sh — §1.1 paired-mutation
# meta-test for CM-HEALTHCHECK-COVERS-SERVED-PORTS (§11.4.201 / §11.4.254).
#
# ── Purpose ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Proves CM-HEALTHCHECK-COVERS-SERVED-PORTS is NOT a bluff gate. Per §1.1 a
# gate is trusted only after its paired mutation has been OBSERVED to make it
# FAIL, and per §11.4.201(1) a false-positive REFUSAL is a FAIL-bluff exactly
# as a false-negative pass is a PASS-bluff — so BOTH polarities are exercised
# for every fixture pair here, including explicit NEGATIVE CONTROLS that the
# gate must NOT fire on.
#
# ── What is proven ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   FAIL-on-mutation:
#     1. the literal BOB-138 shape — one service serving two ports from one
#        process, health check probing only the first;
#     2. a declared service with no health check at all;
#     3. a substring near-miss — a health check probing 71870 while the
#        service serves 7187 (a scanner matching on substring would clear it);
#     4. an UNDECLARED compose service that has a health check and/or ports —
#        silence is not an exemption (§11.4.201(6));
#     5. a STALE manifest entry naming a service absent from the compose file;
#     6. ZERO services checked — the FALSE-NULL property (§11.4.201(6)): an
#        empty manifest must FAIL, never quietly pass;
#     7. ALL-EMPTY `serves` lists — the same false-null by a different route;
#     8. no python interpreter with PyYAML — the BLIND-GATE property: the gate
#        must FAIL, never SKIP and never PASS (§11.4.201(4));
#     9. a missing input file.
#   PASS-on-clean (negative controls — the gate MUST NOT fire):
#     A. a service whose health check legitimately covers ALL its served ports
#        (the primary §11.4.201(1) false-refusal guard);
#     B. a multi-service fixture where every service is fully covered, using
#        a mix of list-form and string-form `test:` and a multi-port probe;
#     C. a compose service with neither health check nor ports that is absent
#        from the manifest — it is not "undeclared", it publishes nothing.
#
# ── Usage ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   cm_healthcheck_covers_served_ports_mutation_test.sh
#
# ── Side-effects ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   Creates + removes a temp fixture dir under $TMPDIR (trap-cleaned on EXIT).
#   No network, no container runtime, no live port ever probed — every fixture
#   is inert YAML TEXT the gate reads, never a running service.
#
# ── Dependencies ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   bash, the sibling gate script, and a python interpreter with PyYAML (the
#   same dependency the gate itself declares). Parses clean under bash -n.
#
# ── Exit codes ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   0 — gate FAILs-on-mutation AND PASSes-on-clean for every fixture pair
#       (the §1.1 proof holds).
#   1 — a fixture did not produce its expected verdict (bluff gate, or a
#       false-positive refusal).
#   2 — environment error (gate script missing, or no python with PyYAML, in
#       which case the meta-test cannot see and says so rather than passing).
#
# ── Cross-references ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   §1.1 (paired mutation), §11.4.201 (the anchor enforced — (1) false-positive
#   refusal, (4) conservative-safe default, (6) a null is not evidence),
#   §11.4.254, §11.4.107(10) (self-validated analyzer: golden-good +
#   golden-bad + negative control), §11.4.28 (gate driven via flags, no
#   hardcoded project path).
#
# Classification: universal (§11.4.17).
