# cm_anchor_record_complete.sh — CM-ANCHOR-RECORD-COMPLETE (task T327)
#
# ── What this gate asserts ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
# T327: "asserts `head_digest` and `entry_count` are both present and that
#        `anchor_strength` equals the probe's verified result, FAILing on any
#        `mechanism` value with no probe evidence behind it."
#
# It asserts BEHAVIOUR, not the presence of files. Every check below drives the
# SHIPPED mechanism — the `continuum-integrity` shell seam and the `pkg/anchor`
# package it adapts — and this gate is the independent oracle over the result
# (§11.4.249: the producer is the engine, the oracle is here, and they are not
# the same actor). A gate that grepped for a filename, a function name, or the
# literal string `mechanism` would be exactly the bluff this feature exists to
# kill (§11.4.227(A): a prose carrier is never an implementation; §11.4.108:
# source-present is not runtime-active).
#
# ── The two properties this gate must respect ────────────────────────────────
# 1. `policy` IS THE HONEST CURRENT STATE, NOT A FAILURE. `GitNonFastForwardProbe`
#    has no path returning verified-true, because no read-only git operation
#    reports a server's branch protection. A gate that FAILed on `policy` would
#    be a §11.4.201(1) FAIL-bluff condemning the true record.
# 2. A PROBE-VERIFIED `mechanism` MUST BE ACCEPTED. The rule is "record what was
#    probed", never "never say mechanism". A validator that refused every
#    `mechanism` would satisfy a naive test while being useless, so that
#    false-positive guard is a first-class check here (A8).
#
# ── Checks (each one PASS/FAIL/SKIP, machine-readable `RESULT <id> <verdict>`) ─
#   golden-TRUE  (a violation MUST make the gate FAIL):
#     A4  a recorded `mechanism` cross-checked against a live probe that
#         established only `policy` is DETECTED at the seam (exit 3)
#     A5a an anchor with NO entry_count is REFUSED at the read seam (exit 4)
#         AND refused *for that reason* (the refusal names entry_count)
#     A5b an anchor with NO head_digest is REFUSED at the read seam (exit 4)
#     A9  `mechanism` recorded against a probe that never ran is refused
#     A10 `mechanism` recorded against a probe that established `policy` is refused
#     A12b/A12c the shipped validator refuses a record missing either field
#   golden-FALSE (a clean state MUST NOT make the gate fire — §11.4.201(1)):
#     A6  an honest `policy` anchor cross-checked against a live probe PASSes
#     A7  a CARRIER anchor — one whose bytes MENTION the token `mechanism` in a
#         non-load-bearing field while recording `policy` — still PASSes
#         (§11.4.201(7)(a): the token is not the thing)
#     A8  a probe-verified `mechanism` is ACCEPTED
#     A11 a probe-established `policy` recorded as `policy` is ACCEPTED
#     A12a a complete record is accepted
#   equality-to-probe (the load-bearing T327 clause):
#     A1  the seam's written record carries a 64-hex head_digest and an
#         entry_count EQUAL to the chain's real line count (counted here,
#         independently of anything the engine reports)
#     A2  written with no remote, the recorded strength is `unknown` — the
#         probe SKIPped, so NEITHER value may be claimed (§11.4.6)
#     A3  written with a reachable remote, the recorded strength EQUALS the
#         value the probe itself established (read from the probe's own
#         result field, never from a hardcoded expectation)
#
# ── Control needles (§11.4.201(7)(b)) ────────────────────────────────────────
# Every ABSENCE this gate reports is preceded by a class-matched needle proving
# the instrument can see that class of value through the SAME path:
#   N1  the strength reader is shown reading `mechanism` out of a fixture that
#       has one, before A2 is allowed to report "the record does not say
#       mechanism". A zero from a blind reader is reported as INSTRUMENT BLIND
#       (exit 4 REFUSE), never as a clean artifact.
#   N2  the exit-code observer is shown observing a NON-zero exit through the
#       same invocation path, before any "exit was 0" claim is trusted.
#   N3  the ORACLE-line parser is shown parsing a known-present id.
#
# The shared needle helper for these gates is task T324
# (`constitution/scripts/gates/lib/chain_control_needle.sh`). It was ABSENT when
# this gate was written (measured twice), and §11.4.251 forbids landing a second
# near-identical copy of it, so the three needles above are implemented INLINE
# and are owed a migration onto that helper the moment its contract lands. This
# gate deliberately does NOT create that file.
#
# ── Usage ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   cm_anchor_record_complete.sh [--engine <dir>] [--quiet]
#     --engine <dir>  continuum engine root (default: <gates>/../../submodules/continuum)
#     --quiet         suppress per-check PASS lines (FAIL/SKIP/RESULT always shown)
#
# ── Exit codes ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   0  PASS     every check decided and held
#   1  FAIL     at least one check decided against the mechanism
#   4  REFUSE   the gate could not decide (toolchain absent, build failed, an
#               instrument proved blind). NEVER 0: "I checked nothing" must not
#               read as "verified" (§11.4.201(6) false-null).
#
# ── Side-effects ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   Writes ONLY under a private mktemp -d, removed on exit. It builds the
#   engine's binaries with `go build -o <tmp>` and builds its own probe harness
#   from a throwaway module in that tmp dir which `replace`s the module path to
#   --engine, so the code under test is the real in-repo source and the repo
#   itself is never written to. A local throwaway bare git repo is created in
#   the tmp dir to give the strength probe a REACHABLE remote (a probe against
#   an unreachable remote is UNKNOWN, which would test nothing).
#
# ── Dependencies ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   POSIX sh, go, git, jq. Any absent -> REFUSE with the reason named.
#
# ── Paired §1.1 mutation ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
