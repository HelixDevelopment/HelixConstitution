# cm_rule_binds_to_seam_mutation_test.sh — §1.1 paired mutation for
# CM-RULE-BINDS-TO-SEAM.
#
# ── Purpose ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Proves each of the gate's three named assertions is LOAD-BEARING: mutate the
# condition the assertion depends on, and THAT assertion's verdict must flip.
# A gate whose mutation does not flip it is decoration; a §1.1 pair that flips
# a NEIGHBOURING assertion instead of its named one proves nothing about the
# assertion it claims to cover.
#
# That second failure mode is not hypothetical — it was found on this feature
# (FINDINGS.md F-002-02: a declared mutation renamed only a REASON TOKEN while
# the refusal MECHANISM survived, so the mutation's declared target still
# passed). Every case below therefore asserts BOTH the flipped exit code AND
# the specific closed-set refusal reason, so a flip caused by a different
# check cannot be mistaken for the named one.
#
# ── Cases ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   M1  FR-011 — a rule row with an EMPTY seam field.
#                Clean: ALLOW.  Mutated: REFUSE + `rule_NAMES_NO_SEAM`-class
#                refusal naming the empty seam.
#   M2  FR-018 — a duplicate (seam-id, gate-token) row on a newly declared
#                anchor.
#                Clean: ALLOW.  Mutated: REFUSE + `rule_IS_RESTATEMENT`
#                NAMING the covering rule.
#   M3  FR-010 — the no-seam COUNT bumped upward past the recorded ceiling.
#                Clean: ALLOW.  Mutated: FAIL + `FR-010 ratchet violated`.
#                Both directions of the comparison are exercised: M3a raises
#                the COUNT above a fixed ceiling, M3b lowers the CEILING below
#                a fixed count. If either direction did not flip, the
#                comparison would be hardcoded on one side.
#   M4  SOURCE — the FR-018 pair-collision check is deleted from an
#                OUT-OF-REPO COPY of the gate. M2's fixture must then STOP
#                refusing. This is the anti-tautology proof: it shows M2's
#                flip comes from the gate's own code, not from an unrelated
#                check that happens to fire on the same fixture.
#   NEG NEGATIVE CONTROL — a correctly bound new rule MUST pass, so the
#                mechanism cannot become a refuse-everything engine
#                (§11.4.201(1): a false-positive refusal is a FAIL-bluff of
#                the same severity as a false pass).
#
# ── §11.4.84 working-tree quiescence ─────────────────────────────────────────
# NOTHING in the repository is mutated. Data mutations are applied to fixture
# files inside a mktemp dir; the one SOURCE mutation (M4) is applied to a COPY
# of the gate placed OUTSIDE the repository. The real gate is checksummed
# before and after and the equality is asserted, so this test cannot leave
# mutation residue behind.
#
# ── Usage / Exit codes ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   cm_rule_binds_to_seam_mutation_test.sh
#     0 — every mutation flipped its NAMED assertion and the negative control
#         passed; the real gate is byte-identical to its pre-run state.
#     1 — a mutation did not flip, flipped the wrong assertion, the negative
#         control fired, or the gate file changed.
#     2 — the harness could not run (gate missing, mktemp failed, git absent).
#
# Classification: universal (§11.4.17).
