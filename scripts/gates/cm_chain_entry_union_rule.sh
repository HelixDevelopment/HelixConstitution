# cm_chain_entry_union_rule.sh — CM-CHAIN-ENTRY-UNION-RULE gate (T325).
#
# ── What this gate asserts ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The union rule (FR-026, FR-027, FR-028) says a chain entry is REQUIRED for
# every state-changing call (write, exec, deploy) and for every read CITED as
# evidence, and is NOT required for an uncited read.
#
#   UNION-A0  the classifier source is present                     (structural)
#   UNION-A1  write / exec / deploy REQUIRE an entry                  (RUNTIME)
#   UNION-A2  a CITED read REQUIRES an entry                          (RUNTIME)
#   UNION-A3  an UNCITED read does NOT                                (RUNTIME)
#   UNION-A4  VerifyComplete PASSes a chain whose only missing entries
#             are for uncited reads — FR-027 where it actually bites  (RUNTIME)
#   UNION-A5  VerifyComplete still DETECTs a genuine shortfall        (RUNTIME)
#   UNION-A6  the classifier is WIRED at the recording path         (structural)
#   UNION-A7  that wiring is EXERCISED: the consumer is BUILT and RUN
#             on rows the REAL producer emitted, and both verdicts are
#             reachable                                               (RUNTIME)
#
# A3 and A4 are the FR-027 FALSE-POSITIVE half, and they are HARD ASSERTIONS,
# not comments. A gate that demanded an entry for every read would not be
# stricter — it would be WRONG, and per §11.4.201(1) a false refusal is a
# FAIL-bluff exactly as serious as a false pass: it condemns correct behaviour
# and teaches people to route around the verifier. A5 is the guard in the other
# direction, so the rule cannot be "satisfied" by a classifier that demands
# nothing of anybody.
#
# ── Why the assertions are RUN, not grepped ──────────────────────────────────
# §11.4.227(A): a prose carrier never counts as an implementation, and a gate
# that greps for a function name is the exact bluff this feature exists to
# kill. A1-A5 therefore EXECUTE the shipped classifier through a throwaway Go
# probe that imports the real package, and assert on what it actually returns.
#
# ── Why A6 is a hard assertion and may FAIL ──────────────────────────────────
# §11.4.108: source-present is NOT runtime-active. A classifier that exists but
# is called from nothing except its own unit test does not classify anything
# that happens. If A6 FAILs, the gate is working: the honest reading is that
# the recording path has not yet been wired (see T315 / T323 / T333), NOT that
# the gate is broken.
#
# ── Absence discipline ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Every absence this gate reports is certified by a class-matched control
# needle through the SAME tool, flags and targets (§11.4.201(7)(b), T324). An
# uncertified zero is reported BLIND and fails the gate — it is an undecided
# result, and undecided reported as intact is the bluff §11.4.201(6) forbids.
#
# ── Usage ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   cm_chain_entry_union_rule.sh [--module <continuum-root>]
#     --module <dir>  the continuum module root
#                     (default: <this script>/../../submodules/continuum)
#
# ── Outputs ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   CN-VERDICT<TAB><ID><TAB><PASS|FAIL|BLIND|SKIP><TAB><message> per assertion,
#   then CN-SUMMARY. Exit 0 only when nothing FAILed and nothing was BLIND.
#
# ── Side-effects ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   Read-only w.r.t. the repository. The Go probe is built and run ENTIRELY
#   inside a mktemp -d removed on exit; it reaches the module read-only via a
#   `replace` directive and never writes into it.
#
# ── Dependencies ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   POSIX sh, grep, awk, mktemp; `go` for A1-A5 (SKIPped with reason if absent).
