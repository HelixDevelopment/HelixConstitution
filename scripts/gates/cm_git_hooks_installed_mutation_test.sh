# Paired §1.1 mutation for CM-GIT-HOOKS-INSTALLED.
#
# THE MUTATION (one named assertion, not a neighbour):
#   swap the gate's INDEPENDENT two-derivation declared set — D1 (the consumer
#   hook map) cross-checked against D2 (a canonical-filtered scan of the source
#   roots) — for the installer's own `HOOKS=` literal, the self-referential list
#   that is simultaneously its declared set and its install set.
#
# WHAT IT PROVES:
#   the gate stops reporting the missing declared hook, reproducing exactly the
#   D-6 blindness measured on the tree: `--verify` returning `ok=4 missing=0`
#   rc=0 while `post-merge` was absent. If the mutated gate still fired, the
#   two-derivation logic would not be what catches the omission and the gate's
#   GREEN would prove nothing.
#
# NEGATIVE CONTROL (§11.4.201(1)):
#   the UNMUTATED gate on a fixture where every declared hook is installed MUST
#   pass. A mutation test that only shows a gate can be made silent, without
#   showing it is otherwise quiet on a clean tree, cannot distinguish a real
#   detector from a gate that fires on everything.
#
# §11.4.84: the mutation is applied to a COPY in a temp dir outside the repo.
# The in-repo gate is never edited; its checksum is compared before and after.
#
# Exit: 0 all cases held; 1 a case failed.
