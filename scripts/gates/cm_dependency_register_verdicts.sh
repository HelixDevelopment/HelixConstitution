# ── What this gate asserts (FR-013, FR-015) ─────────────────────────────────
#   DRV-A0  the E6 register and its reader are present            (structural)
#   DRV-A1  the REAL register validates                              (RUNTIME)
#   DRV-A2  GOLDEN-BAD : a verdict outside {VERIFIED,AMBIGUOUS,
#                        UNVERIFIED} is refused, NAMING the entry     (RUNTIME)
#   DRV-A3  GOLDEN-BAD : an empty artifact_url is refused, naming it  (RUNTIME)
#   DRV-A4  GOLDEN-BAD : the NAME-COLLISION fixture resolves
#                        AMBIGUOUS and never VERIFIED                 (RUNTIME)
#   DRV-A5  NEGATIVE CONTROL: an exact name+description match DOES
#                        resolve VERIFIED                             (RUNTIME)
#   DRV-A6  GOLDEN-BAD : an UNVERIFIED verdict worded as a claim of
#                        NON-EXISTENCE is refused (A-011)             (RUNTIME)
#
# ── Why A4 is the golden-BAD the task names ─────────────────────────────────
# 2 of the 21 externally named tools in the Phase-0 census were name
# collisions: a real project carries the name and does an unrelated job. A
# resolver that matched on the name would admit precisely the entries most
# likely to look adoptable, so the collision case is the one the selftest is
# built around.
#
# ── Why A5 exists ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Without it, A4 is satisfiable by a resolver that answers AMBIGUOUS to
# everything — refusing correct behaviour, which §11.4.201(1) rates exactly as
# seriously as a false pass.
#
# ── Why A6 exists (A-011) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
# For at least three of the six not-found entries, a real project doing exactly
# the described job exists under a DIFFERENT NAME. "Not found" is therefore an
# absence on one search path, and recording it as non-existence would send the
# next reader to the wrong conclusion.
#
# Usage : cm_dependency_register_verdicts.sh [--register <path>]
# Output: CN-VERDICT / CN-SUMMARY. Exit 0 only when nothing FAILed or was BLIND.
# Deps  : POSIX sh, grep, mktemp. Read-only w.r.t. the repository.
