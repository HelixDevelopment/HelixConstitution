# cm_mechanism_observed_refusing.sh — CM-MECHANISM-OBSERVED-REFUSING gate (T229).
#
# ── What this gate asserts (FR-007) ─────────────────────────────────────────
#   MOR-A0  the E3 mechanism registry is present                  (structural)
#   MOR-A1  GOLDEN-BAD      : a mechanism with NO first_refusal_ref
#                             mints no verdict                       (RUNTIME)
#   MOR-A2  NEGATIVE CONTROL: a mechanism WITH a resolvable
#                             first-refusal record IS accepted       (RUNTIME)
#   MOR-A3  GOLDEN-BAD      : a first_refusal_ref that resolves to
#                             nothing is refused like an absent one  (RUNTIME)
#   MOR-A4  every mechanism in the REAL registry resolves          (structural)
#   MOR-A5  the rule is WIRED at the acceptance seam               (structural)
#
# ── Why MOR-A2 is the load-bearing half ─────────────────────────────────────
# Without it, FR-007 degenerates into "no mechanism is ever trusted" — a gate
# that refuses everything is not stricter, it is broken, and §11.4.201(1) rates
# that false refusal exactly as seriously as a false pass. A2 is the negative
# control the task text requires by name.
#
# ── Why MOR-A3 exists ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A pointer to no record is not a record. Accepting a `first_refusal_ref` field
# merely because it is non-empty would make the requirement satisfiable by
# typing a path, which is the paperwork-instead-of-evidence failure the whole
# feature exists to close.
#
# ── Why MOR-A5 may FAIL, honestly ───────────────────────────────────────────
# §11.4.108: a registry no acceptance seam consults refuses nothing. If A5
# FAILs, the honest reading is that the reader-seam wiring (feature task T225)
# has not landed — not that this gate is broken.
#
# Usage : cm_mechanism_observed_refusing.sh [--registry <path>] [--reader <path>] [--selftest]
# Output: CN-VERDICT / CN-SUMMARY. Exit 0 only when nothing FAILed or was BLIND.
# Deps  : POSIX sh, grep, mktemp. Read-only w.r.t. the repository.
# Xref  : FR-007 · FR-022 · data-model.md E3 · §11.4.115(F)
