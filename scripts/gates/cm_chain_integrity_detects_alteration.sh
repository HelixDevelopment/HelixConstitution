# cm_chain_integrity_detects_alteration.sh — CM-CHAIN-INTEGRITY-DETECTS-ALTERATION
# gate (T326).
#
# ── What this gate asserts ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
# It runs the T301 attack corpus through the SHIPPED verifier and asserts what
# the verifier actually returns for each fixture:
#
#   CHAIN-A0  the shipped verifier builds and the corpus generates  (precondition)
#   CHAIN-A1  MUTATION  is DETECTED
#   CHAIN-A2  DELETION  is DETECTED
#   CHAIN-A3  REORDER   is DETECTED
#   CHAIN-A4  a chain that cannot be WALKED returns REFUSE, never PASS (FR-030)
#   CHAIN-A5  an ABSENT store returns REFUSE, never PASS
#   CHAIN-A6  a HEALTHY chain still PASSes                (false-positive guard)
#   CHAIN-A7  the two DOCUMENTED-LIMIT attacks PASS chain-alone
#
# ── Why A6 and A7 are not padding ────────────────────────────────────────────
# A verifier that refused everything would satisfy A1-A5 perfectly and be
# useless. §11.4.201(1): a false refusal is a FAIL-bluff exactly as serious as
# a false pass. A6 is the direct guard.
#
# A7 asserts the two rows the chain alone genuinely CANNOT see — tail
# truncation, and deletion followed by a full re-chain. Both leave a chain that
# is internally perfect: contiguous sequence numbers, every prev_digest
# matching its predecessor. A chain can only ever prove internal consistency;
# it cannot know what it SHOULD have contained. Only the anchor carries that,
# which is why the security lives in the anchor and the window of forgeability
# equals the anchor interval.
#
# So A7 asserts these PASS. Asserting DETECTED would be asserting a falsehood
# and would push someone to "fix" a documented structural limit; asserting
# nothing would let a verifier that refuses everything slip through. The
# anchor-side detection of these two rows is T328's gate, not this one.
#
# ── Why it RUNS rather than greps ────────────────────────────────────────────
# §11.4.227(A): a prose carrier never counts as an implementation, and
# §11.4.108: source-present is not runtime-active. Every verdict below is read
# from a real execution of the built verifier over a real fixture.
#
# ── Reading the verdict STRUCTURALLY ─────────────────────────────────────────
# The verifier's JSON `reason` string quotes verdict words ("chain_alone is
# DETECTED: ..."), so a substring search for DETECTED would match a CARRIER as
# readily as the field (§11.4.201(7)(a)). Verdicts are therefore extracted by
# OBJECT — the verdict belonging to `chain_alone` — and an unreadable
# extraction is reported BLIND, never as a verdict that failed to match.
#
# ── Usage ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   cm_chain_integrity_detects_alteration.sh [--module <continuum-root>] [--n N]
#     --n N   corpus size (default 12; structural fixture, not a benchmark)
#
# ── Outputs ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   CN-VERDICT / CN-SUMMARY lines. Exit 0 only if nothing FAILed or was BLIND.
#
# ── Side-effects ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   Read-only w.r.t. the repository: the verifier binary, the generated corpus
#   and the torn fixture all live inside a mktemp -d removed on exit.
#
# ── Dependencies ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   POSIX sh, grep, awk, mktemp, head, tail, cut, wc; `go` (SKIP with reason
#   if absent — an unexecuted verifier has demonstrated nothing).
