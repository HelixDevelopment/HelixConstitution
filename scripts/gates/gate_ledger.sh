# gate_ledger.sh — §11.4.227(A) named-gate LEDGER + monotone-decrease ratchet.
#
# ── Purpose ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# §11.4.227(A) requires every `CM-*`-class token NAMED in the governance
# corpus to be, at every build, either IMPLEMENTED (the token appears
# STRUCTURALLY inside a real executable gate site — never a prose carrier,
# §11.4.201(7)(a)) or covered by a REGISTERED DEFERRAL row pointing at a
# tracked follow-up item. Tokens satisfying NEITHER are "UNIMPLEMENTED" —
# legal silent debt is CLOSED: the unimplemented COUNT is a checked-in,
# MONOTONE-DECREASING ratchet (day-one baseline = the count measured at
# landing, so the ledger is GREEN on arrival and can only shrink from there —
# the §11.4.135-ratchet pattern applied to gate custody instead of test
# coverage). A gate NAME that vanishes from the corpus without an explicit
# removal citation FAILs (closes the delete-the-name-to-lower-the-count
# gaming channel; a genuine repeal, e.g. the §11.4.166 precedent, stays legal
# via the citation).
#
# Per §11.4.227(A): "an anchor's done state is its SEAM landing, not its
# TEXT landing" — this tool measures the SEAM (does an executable gate site
# exist / is the debt registered), never the prose.
#
# ── Structure-not-substring (§11.4.201(7)(a)) ───────────────────────────────
# An "implementation" is the gate's literal CM- token found INSIDE an
# executable `*.sh` file under the implementation tree (every real gate site
# in this corpus assigns its own name to a `GATE=` variable or an echoed
# string — a load-bearing, structural occurrence, not a passing mention).
# A `*.md` file (or any non-`.sh` file) that merely MENTIONS the token is a
# CARRIER and MUST NOT count as an implementation. A `*_mutation_test.sh`
# sibling that references the SAME token as the gate it tests is likewise
# excluded from counting as the implementation site (it is the gate's own
# §1.1 mutation harness, not the gate) — only a NON-mutation-test `.sh` hit
# counts as IMPLEMENTED.
#
# ── Tracked-ness: an UNTRACKED file is not an implementation site ────────
# A `.sh` file that exists only in the working tree — never `git add`ed — is
# NOT an implementation site, because a fresh clone of the repository does not
# contain it. Counting one moves the §11.4.227(A) monotone-decrease ratchet on
# local-only state that nobody else can reproduce: a PHANTOM ADVANCE, and
# exactly the bluff shape the ratchet exists to prevent (§11.4/§11.4.1 at the
# measurement layer, §11.4.201(6) — a working-tree grep and a repository are
# not the same instrument).
#
# Forensic FACT (measured 2026-08-23 on this corpus, the defect that motivated
# this clause): two never-committed files under `scripts/gates/` minted one
# `IMPLEMENTED` row, and the ledger reported `unimplemented=418 baseline=419`
# — a ratchet ADVANCE — while a fresh clone measured 419. The scan was a bare
# filesystem `grep` with ZERO git-awareness (`git ` occurred 0 times in this
# file; control needle: `UNIMPLEMENTED`=16, `grep`=18, negative control 0).
#
# So every candidate hit is additionally filtered by TRACKED-NESS, resolved
# from the repository that OWNS the scanned path (`rev-parse --show-toplevel`
# on `<impl-dir>`, never a hardcoded project path — §11.4.177/§11.4.28 keep
# this engine project-agnostic and consumer-inherited BY REFERENCE).
#
#   * TRACKED  = present in that repository's INDEX (`git ls-files` /
#                `--error-unmatch` semantics). A tracked file that is merely
#                MODIFIED still counts — excluding it would be a
#                §11.4.201(1) false-positive refusal, a FAIL-bluff of the same
#                severity as the phantom advance. Only genuinely untracked
#                files are dropped.
#   * A `git status --porcelain | grep '^??'` parse is NEVER used: status
#     COLLAPSES an untracked directory into a single entry (measured on this
#     corpus: 10 status entries vs 34 real files), so it under-reports.
#   * NESTED repositories are honoured: a hit the outer `ls-files` does not
#     list is re-resolved against its OWN owning repository before being
#     declared untracked, so a gate living inside a nested submodule is not
#     falsely dropped.
#
# HONEST BOUNDARY (§11.4.6): "tracked" here means INDEX-tracked, not
# HEAD-committed. A staged-but-uncommitted file counts, and is likewise absent
# from a fresh clone until pushed; staging is the deliberate act this engine
# treats as the tracking boundary, matching the conventional meaning of
# "tracked". A consumer whose gate sites are GENERATED at build time and
# deliberately gitignored would see them stop counting under this rule; that
# case is a §11.4.66 operator decision (commit the generated wrappers, or
# register their deferral), never a silent re-loosening of this filter.
# Measured on this corpus at landing: 313 tracked + 4 untracked = 317 `.sh`
# on disk, ZERO ignored — the generated propagation wrappers ARE committed, so
# this filter changes no legitimate classification here.
#
# ── The `--` footgun this tool avoids (§11.4.201(7)(c) — the path is part of
#     the instrument) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# `grep -rlE --include='*.sh' -- "$g" "$IMPL"` MUST keep every OPTION
# (`--include=...`) BEFORE the `--` end-of-options marker. Reordering so `--`
# precedes `--include` silently turns `--include` into a FILENAME argument
# and the include-filter stops matching real gate sites — the exact class of
# confident-wrong-answer-without-crashing this project's own §11.4.201(7)(c)
# anchor describes (first caught inside this tool's SOL-05 proof-of-concept
# ancestor's own RED->GREEN loop).
#
# ── Usage ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   gate_ledger.sh generate <impl-dir> <deferrals-tsv> <corpus-file> [<corpus-file> ...]
#       -> emits a ledger TSV on stdout: `<gate>\t<STATUS>\t<evidence>`
#          STATUS in {IMPLEMENTED, DEFERRED, UNIMPLEMENTED}.
#
#   gate_ledger.sh check <ledger-file> <baseline-file> <prev-names-file> [<removals-tsv>]
#       -> ratchet + vanished-name checks; prints a summary line; exit 0/1/2.
#
#   gate_ledger.sh selfcheck <scratch-impl-dir>
#       -> control-needle + golden-good/golden-bad/deferred self-test of this
#          tool itself (§11.4.201(7)(b) — a null result is not evidence until
#          the instrument is proven to see).
#
#   gate_ledger.sh nongate-entries
#       -> prints the REGISTERED NON-GATE entries (one path-suffix per
#          line) that are excluded from the §11.4.227(A) gate-count
#          denominator, so every enumerator (this tool's own generate
#          scan, the FR-019 wiring sweep, any future counter) consumes
#          ONE registry instead of re-deriving the list. Exit 0.
#
# ── Inputs ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   <impl-dir>       tree scanned recursively for `*.sh` gate sites (this
#                    project's canonical scan root is `constitution/scripts`
#                    — gate implementations are NOT confined to
#                    `scripts/gates/`; several live under `scripts/hooks/`,
#                    `scripts/multitrack/`, `scripts/doc_integrity/wire/`,
#                    `scripts/helix_code/`, and `scripts/`, so a scan
#                    confined to `scripts/gates/` alone would UNDER-COUNT
#                    implementations and inflate the unimplemented figure —
#                    a false-FAIL of the exact §11.4.201(1) class this
#                    project forbids).
#   <deferrals-tsv>  `<gate>\t<tracked-item-id>[\t<note>]` rows, one per
#                    registered deferral. May be empty (header-only or
#                    zero-byte) — an empty registry is a HONEST statement
#                    that no deferral has yet been registered, not a defect.
#   <corpus-file>    one or more governance files to extract `CM-*` tokens
#                    from. This project's canonical corpus is
#                    `constitution/Constitution.md` — the anchor's own
#                    source-of-truth location per every existing
#                    `cm_covenant_*_propagation.sh` gate's documented
#                    convention; the four mirror files (CLAUDE/AGENTS/QWEN/
#                    GEMINI.md) restate the SAME anchors and are the concern
#                    of the SEPARATE anchor-block-integrity gates
#                    (§11.4.227(B)), not this ledger.
#
# ── Non-gate entries: the §11.4.227(A) gate-count DENOMINATOR ───────────────
# Not every `*.sh` file living in a gate directory IS a gate. Three classes
# routinely sit beside real gates and MUST NOT participate in the count:
#   * LIBRARIES sourced by real gates (they carry the shared engine, not a
#     verdict — a gate token appearing inside one is the library's own
#     template/placeholder text, never that gate's implementation site);
#   * GENERATORS that emit gate files (the generator is build tooling, not a
#     gate — it names tokens in the wrappers it writes);
#   * pointer/carrier helpers that hold a LITERAL placeholder spelling of a
#     token family (e.g. a `...-NNN-...` form) purely as documentation.
#
# Counting any of these as an implementation site is precisely the
# §11.4.201(7)(a) CARRIER miscount this tool exists to prevent: the file
# MENTIONS the token, it does not IMPLEMENT it. The exclusion filter already
# skipped non-`.sh` files and `*_mutation_test.sh` siblings; this registry
# closes the remaining hole for non-gate `.sh` entries.
#
# The registry is DATA (§11.4.35 / §11.4.28 — a consuming project supplies
# its own): the built-in default below is overridable by pointing
# `GATE_LEDGER_NONGATE_FILE` at a newline-delimited file of path-suffixes.
# An override path that cannot be read is a REFUSAL, never a silently empty
# registry (§11.4.252 fail-closed, §11.4.6 no-guessing) — a blind-empty
# registry would silently restore the carrier miscount.
#
# Entries are matched as PATH SUFFIXES so the registry is stable no matter
# which ancestor directory the caller passes as `<impl-dir>` (§11.4.111
# resolve-by-stable-name, not by a caller-relative accident).
#
# REGISTERED != RETIRED. These files are NOT deleted, NOT retired and NOT
# deprecated by this registry (§11.4.124 investigate-before-remove): they
# remain fully live, sourced and executed exactly as before. They stop being
# COUNTED, and nothing else.
#
# ── Outputs ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   generate: TSV ledger on stdout.
#   check:    per-violation lines + `LEDGER: unimplemented=N baseline=B fails=F`
#             summary; exit 1 if fails>0.
#   selfcheck: SELFCHECK-FAIL lines + exit 2/1 on any self-test failure;
#              `SELFCHECK: PASS ...` + exit 0 when the instrument is proven
#              sound.
#
# ── Side-effects ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   None (read-only). `selfcheck` creates + removes its own `mktemp -d`
#   scratch tree; it never touches the caller-supplied `<impl-dir>`.
#
# ── Dependencies ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

#   §11.4.135 (the monotone-decrease-ratchet pattern this reuses),
#   §11.4.6 (no-guessing — an unresolvable file is BLIND, exit 2, never a
#   guessed zero), §11.4.66/§11.4.122 (brownfield-adoption + exclusion
#   decisions stay operator-owned DATA, never invented by this tool), §1.1
#   (paired mutation — name a new gate with no implementation and no

#   generate: 0 on a non-empty ledger; 2 on BLIND (unreadable input / zero
#             tokens extracted from a non-empty corpus — the corpus needs a
#             control needle before an empty extraction is trusted).
#   check:    0 — ratchet holds, no vanished-name violation.
#             1 — ratchet exceeded and/or a vanished name lacks a citation.
#             2 — BLIND (an input file could not be read).
