# cm_zero_findings_audit_sweep_mutation_test.sh — §1.1 paired mutation test
# for cm_zero_findings_audit_sweep.sh (§11.4.261(B) / CM-ZERO-FINDINGS-AUDIT-SWEEP).
#
# ── Purpose ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Proves the gate is genuinely load-bearing (§1.1): golden-good PASSes, each
# distinct mutation class correctly FAILs with the right reason, restore
# PASSes again (the gate re-evaluates live, not stuck), and a false-positive
# guard is exercised (a class name referenced only in a comment MUST still
# count as covering the class — presence, not behaviour, is this gate's
# honest boundary). All work happens in a disposable mktemp -d scratch tree
# (§11.4.84 — never the real working tree).
#
# ── Sub-cases ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   T1 — golden-GOOD (script present, executable, all 10 vocabulary classes +
#        3 fixture classes named, --selftest exits 0) PASSES.
#   T2 — mutation: strip the executable bit -> FAILs reason=NOT_EXECUTABLE.
#   T3 — restore -> PASSES again.
#   T4 — mutation: remove the "bluff" vocabulary-class line ->
#        FAILs reason=BLUFFS_CLASS_MISSING.
#   T5 — restore.
#   T6 — mutation: remove the "negative-control" fixture-class marker ->
#        FAILs reason=NEGATIVE_CONTROL_FIXTURE_MISSING.
#   T7 — restore.
#   T8 — mutation: --selftest now exits non-zero -> FAILs reason=SELFTEST_FAILED.
#   T9 — restore.
#   T10 — mutation: script deleted entirely -> FAILs reason=SWEEP_SCRIPT_MISSING.
#   T11 — restore + FALSE-POSITIVE GUARD: a fixture whose vocabulary classes
#        are named ONLY inside a `#`-comment block (never in executable code)
#        MUST STILL PASS — presence-in-source is the gate's honest contract,
#        it does not (and cannot, statically) prove behavioural correctness.
#
# ── Usage ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   cm_zero_findings_audit_sweep_mutation_test.sh
#
# ── Exit codes ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   0 — every sub-case behaved as required (gate is genuinely load-bearing).
#   1 — at least one sub-case behaved incorrectly (gate is decoration or broken).
#
# Classification: universal (§11.4.17).
