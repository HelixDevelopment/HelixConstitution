# cm_badge_self_validated_mutation_test.sh — §1.1 paired mutation test for
# CM-BADGE-SELF-VALIDATED.
#
# ── Purpose ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Proves the gate is genuinely load-bearing (§1.1): golden-good PASSes, each
# distinct mutation class correctly FAILs with the right reason, restore
# PASSes again (the gate re-evaluates live, not stuck), and a false-positive
# guard (no badge row at all -> honest vacuous PASS) is exercised. All work
# happens in a disposable mktemp -d scratch tree (§11.4.84 — never the real
# working tree).
#
# ── Usage ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   cm_badge_self_validated_mutation_test.sh
#
# ── Exit codes ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   0 — every sub-case behaved as required.
#   1 — at least one sub-case did NOT behave as required (gate is decoration).
#
# Classification: universal (§11.4.17).
