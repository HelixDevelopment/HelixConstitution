# cm_rule_binds_to_seam.sh — CM-RULE-BINDS-TO-SEAM gate
# (FR-010 / FR-011 / FR-018 — every newly declared enforcement rule resolves
# to a named seam that can refuse, and a restatement of an already-bound
# (seam, gate) pair is refused with the covering rule NAMED.)
#
# ── Purpose ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A rule that names no seam is prose. §11.4.227(A) is explicit that a prose
# carrier NEVER counts as an implementation, and the measured corpus deficit
# (420 named gates with no executable site) is what that gap looks like at
# scale. This gate refuses the DECLARING CHANGE — the moment a rule is added
# — rather than auditing the debt afterwards, because an after-the-fact audit
# is the thing that produced the deficit.
#
# Three checks, in the order they can refuse:
#
#   FR-011  A rule anchor NEWLY added by the change under test that resolves
#           to no row in the bindings registry REFUSES the declaring change.
#           This is the load-bearing check: it is exact and fires on the
#           first offender.
#
#   FR-018  A NEWLY added anchor whose registry row duplicates the
#           normalised (seam-id, gate-token) pair of an already-declared
#           anchor REFUSES as a restatement, NAMING the covering rule.
#           Keyed on the PAIR, never on a bare subject substring — a
#           substring key manufactures collisions between unrelated rules
#           that happen to share a word.
#
#   FR-010  The measured no-seam count must not exceed the recorded baseline
#           integer. This is the aggregate backstop, not the teeth (see the
#           honest boundary on the ratchet's slack, below).
#
# ── Honest boundaries (§11.4.6) — read these before "fixing" anything ───────
#
# (1) THE FR-010 RATCHET HAS MEASURED SLACK AND CANNOT FIRE ON A SINGLE NEW
#     UNBOUND RULE. The baseline file is SHARED with the §11.4.227(A)
#     gate-token ledger (gate_ledger.sh), whose integer counts UNIMPLEMENTED
#     GATE TOKENS (measured 420). The quantity this gate measures is a
#     different population — RULE ANCHORS with no binding row (measured 239
#     on this tree at authoring time, 2026-08-21). 239 < 420, so ~181 new
#     unbound rules could land before the ceiling is reached. That is stated
#     as a measured fact, not papered over: per §11.4.201(8) a metric whose
#     correct end-state does not move it to target is invalid as a gate, and
#     a ceiling with 181 units of slack is a weak one. It is retained
#     because it is monotone and cannot be gamed upward, and because FR-011
#     — which fires on the FIRST unbound rule — is the real refusal. A
#     per-population baseline calibration is OWED work (§11.4.197), tracked,
#     not silently assumed done. This gate NEVER writes the baseline file:
#     gate_ledger.sh:222 parses it as a BARE integer and any annotation
#     added here would break that consumer.
#
# (2) "RESOLVES TO AN EXECUTABLE GATE SITE" IS A REACHABILITY CLAIM, NOT AN
#     EXECUTION CLAIM. This gate proves the named token has an executable
#     file on disk. It does NOT prove that file is reached on every run, nor
#     that it has ever refused anything. That stronger property is the
#     first-refusal evidence layer (FR-022) and is a DIFFERENT stream's
#     deliverable; this gate does not claim it.
#
# (3) PAIR-COLLISION IS THE DECIDABLE PROJECTION OF RESTATEMENT. Two rules
#     that mean the same thing while binding different (seam, gate) pairs are
#     NOT caught here and are not claimed to be. Semantic overlap outside the
#     pair key remains §11.4.142 / §11.4.194 review territory. Claiming
#     otherwise would be a coverage bluff.
#
# (4) PRE-EXISTING duplicate pairs are REPORTED, never refused. Refusing them
#     would retro-refuse a corpus this gate did not author — a false-positive
#     refusal, which §11.4.201(1) holds to be exactly as serious as a false
#     pass. Only NEWLY added anchors can trigger the FR-018 refusal.
#
# ── The carrier filter (§11.4.201(7)(a) — structure, not substring) ─────────
# A block-start line whose anchor id is followed by a LOWERCASE word is an
# amendment/carve-out CARRIER referring to an existing anchor, not a new
# declaration. Measured on this corpus: `**§11.4.30 carve-out.**`,
# `**§11.4.93 amendment.**`, `**§11.4.202 precedence ...**`. Counting those
# as declarations produced 3 phantom duplicates. A declaration's id is
# followed by a dash-led title, never a lowercase word.
#
# Sub-anchors are captured WHOLE (`11.4.10.A` is distinct from `11.4.10`) so a
# sub-anchor never prefix-matches its parent — the §11.4.227(B) trap.
#
# ── Usage ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   cm_rule_binds_to_seam.sh [--root <dir>] [--corpus <path>]
#                            [--bindings <path>] [--gates-dir <dir>]
#                            [--baseline <path>] [--base <git-ref>]
#   cm_rule_binds_to_seam.sh --selftest
#
#     --root      consumer project root (default: $CONSUMER_ROOT, else the
#                 repo root inferred from this script's location).
#     --corpus    governance corpus whose anchors are the rule population
#                 (default: constitution/Constitution.md under --root).
#     --bindings  the registry (default: <gates-dir>/rule_seam_bindings.tsv).
#     --gates-dir directory holding executable gate sites
#                 (default: this script's own directory).
#     --baseline  recorded no-seam ceiling, a bare integer, READ-ONLY
#                 (default: <gates-dir>/gate_ledger_baseline.txt).
#     --base      git ref the change under test is measured AGAINST
#                 (default: HEAD — so uncommitted/staged new anchors are the
#                 "change under test" at the commit seam).
#
# Every path is an argument with a documented default. No project literal is
# hardcoded (§11.4.177 / §11.4.35 — the consumer supplies its paths as DATA).
#
# ── Outputs ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   Per-check lines, then one verdict banner. Every refusal prints the
#   RESOLVED EVIDENCE — the value actually read — so a false positive is
#   diagnosable in one step (gate-verdict.md).
#
# ── Side-effects ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   None. Read-only. Writes only to a mktemp dir it removes on exit.
#
# ── Dependencies ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   POSIX sh, awk, grep, sed, sort, cut, git (for --base resolution).
#   Parses clean under `sh -n` AND `bash -n` (§11.4.67).
#
# ── Exit codes (contracts/gate-verdict.md — three verdicts, never two) ──────
#   0  ALLOW  — every applicable check passed against real evidence.
#   1  FAIL   — a check ran and the condition was genuinely violated.
#   2  REFUSE — the gate COULD NOT DECIDE: an input was unreadable, the
#               control needle came back blind, or a required field was
#               absent. A REFUSE sends someone to fix the INSTRUMENT; a FAIL
#               sends someone to fix the PRODUCT. Collapsing one into the
#               other is the defect the contract exists to prevent.
#
#   FR-011 and FR-018 violations are REFUSE (reasons `rule_NAMES_NO_SEAM`
#   and `rule_IS_RESTATEMENT`, emitted verbatim from the closed set): the
#   declaring change is refused. The FR-010 ratchet breach is a FAIL — the
#   condition is real, measured, and about the product's state.
