#!/usr/bin/env bash
# lib_badge_row.sh — shared README badge-row parsing helpers for the
# §11.4.259 badge-mechanism gate family (cm_readme_badge_row_at_top.sh,
# cm_badge_closed_color_vocabulary.sh, cm_badge_machine_derived_source.sh,
# cm_badge_self_validated.sh).
#
# ── Purpose ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# §11.4.259 mandates a comprehensive badge row at the TOP of README.md,
# immediately below the H1 title and above the introduction — the reader's
# first visual signal. All four gates in this family need the SAME two
# primitives: (1) locate that badge row (or prove it is absent/misplaced),
# (2) parse the individual `![alt](url)` badge entries out of it. This
# library provides both, so each gate composes them rather than
# re-implementing markdown parsing four times.
#
# ── Badge-row location contract ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# The badge row is the FIRST non-blank line strictly AFTER the document's
# first-level heading (`# <title>`) that consists ENTIRELY of one or more
# Markdown image links (`![alt](url)`, optionally separated by whitespace)
# and nothing else. If the first non-blank line after the H1 is NOT
# badge-shaped (ordinary prose, a blockquote, another heading, etc.), there
# is NO badge row at the top — §11.4.259's placement requirement is violated
# and callers MUST treat that as absence, never search further down the
# document for a badge-shaped line elsewhere (a badge row buried mid-document
# is not "at the top" and is NOT what this library reports).
#
# ── Functions ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   br_badge_row_text <readme_abs_path>
#       Prints the badge-row line's raw text on stdout (exit 0) if found per
#       the contract above; prints nothing and exits 1 if the file has no H1,
#       or the first non-blank line after the H1 is not badge-shaped, or the
#       file does not exist.
#
#   br_extract_entries <badge_row_text>
#       Reads badge-row text (e.g. via stdin redirection <<<) and emits one
#       line per badge entry: "<alt><TAB><url>". Badges are recognised by the
#       `![alt](url)` Markdown image syntax; anything else on the line is
#       ignored (so a badge row may freely mix inline whitespace/separators
#       between badges).
#
#   br_color_token <url_or_alt>
#       Extracts a color TOKEN from a badge's URL or alt text: the last
#       `-<word>` (or `_<word>`) segment before a query string, OR any
#       standalone occurrence of a closed-vocabulary color word anywhere in
#       the string (case-insensitive). Prints the lowercase token on stdout
#       (exit 0) if a plausible candidate is found, or prints nothing (exit 1)
#       if no color-shaped token is present at all. Does NOT validate the
#       token is in the closed set — that judgement belongs to the calling
#       gate (this function is a pure extraction primitive, reusable by any
#       future vocabulary decision).
#
# ── Cross-references ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   §11.4.259 (this gate family's mandate), §11.4.6 (no-guessing — badge-row
#   location is a strict positional contract, never a document-wide search),
#   §11.4.28/§11.4.35 (manifests/provenance files are consumer DATA, never
#   project literals in this submodule).
#
# Classification: universal (§11.4.17).
