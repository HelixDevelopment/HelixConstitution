# cm_control_needle_required.sh — CM-CONTROL-NEEDLE-REQUIRED gate (T227).
#
# ── What this gate asserts (FR-005, FR-006) ─────────────────────────────────
#   CNR-A0  the E4 control-needle evaluator is present            (structural)
#   CNR-A1  GOLDEN-GOOD    : a needled zero is ACCEPTED              (RUNTIME)
#   CNR-A2  GOLDEN-BAD     : an UNNEEDLED zero is REFUSED            (RUNTIME)
#   CNR-A3  GOLDEN-BAD     : a BLIND needle is REFUSED with a reason
#                            DISTINCT from the absent-needle one     (RUNTIME)
#   CNR-A4  NEGATIVE CONTROL: a same-path needle certifies, a
#                            different-path needle does not          (RUNTIME)
#   CNR-A5  the rule is WIRED at the acceptance seam               (structural)
#
# ── Why A1 and A4's positive leg exist ──────────────────────────────────────
# A gate that refused every zero would satisfy A2 and A3 while being a
# false-refusal engine, and per §11.4.201(1) a false refusal is a FAIL-bluff
# exactly as serious as a false pass: it condemns correct behaviour and teaches
# people to route around the verifier. A1/A4 are the guard in that direction.
#
# ── Why A3 requires the reasons to be DISTINCT ──────────────────────────────
# `control_needle_ABSENT` and `control_needle_BLIND` name two different
# defects. ABSENT means nobody certified the instrument; BLIND means somebody
# did and it could not see. Collapsing them hides which of the two occurred and
# therefore hides who has to fix what.
#
# ── Why A5 is a hard assertion and MAY FAIL ─────────────────────────────────
# §11.4.108: source-present is not runtime-active. A rule implemented in a
# library that no acceptance seam consults refuses nothing. If A5 FAILs the
# gate is WORKING; the honest reading is that the reader seam has not been
# wired yet (feature task T224), NOT that this gate is broken.
#
# ── Absence discipline ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A5's absence is certified by a class-matched control needle through the SAME
# tool and flags (§11.4.201(7)(b)). An uncertified zero is reported BLIND and
# fails the gate — undecided reported as intact is the bluff §11.4.201(6)
# forbids.
#
# Usage : cm_control_needle_required.sh [--reader <path>] [--selftest]
# Output: CN-VERDICT<TAB><ID><TAB><PASS|FAIL|BLIND|SKIP><TAB><msg>, then CN-SUMMARY.
#         Exit 0 only when nothing FAILed and nothing was BLIND.
# Deps  : POSIX sh, grep, mktemp. Read-only w.r.t. the repository.
