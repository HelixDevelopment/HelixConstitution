# dependency_register.sh — E6 dependency register: read, verdict resolution and
# the adoption preconditions (T221; FR-013, FR-014, FR-015, FR-020, FR-021).
#
# ── The rule this file mechanises ───────────────────────────────────────────
# An externally named dependency is admitted ONLY on a VERIFIED existence
# verdict that is also mapped to one of the recorded uncovered gaps. Three
# separate facts, none of which implies another:
#
#   verdict            does a real artifact exist?        VERIFIED|AMBIGUOUS|UNVERIFIED
#   capability_status  does it DO the thing?              SHIPPED|CLAIMED|CONTRADICTED|UNREACHABLE
#   gap_mapping        do we actually lack that thing?    a row in the gap table
#
# ── Why capability_status is a SEPARATE axis (A-012) ────────────────────────
# EXISTING IS NOT THE SAME AS WORKING. Measured in Phase 0: several verified
# entries sit at initial release versions, one declares a repository that
# returns 404, and one's "tamper-evident" claim is on inspection only
# "append-only" — which detects nothing if the appender is the party being
# checked. So FR-013 existence verification is NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT,
# and a capability claim must be demonstrated rather than read off a project
# description. That is why `adopt` refuses a row whose artifact cannot be cited
# even when its verdict is VERIFIED.
#
# ── Why a name match alone never resolves VERIFIED (FR-015, A-001) ──────────
# 2 of the 21 externally named tools in the Phase-0 census were NAME
# COLLISIONS: a real project carries the name, doing an unrelated job. Name and
# description are therefore read as SEPARATE axes and a name-only match
# resolves AMBIGUOUS. Resolving on the name would admit exactly the entries
# most likely to look adoptable.
#
# ── Why "not found" is worded as an absence on a search path (A-011) ────────
# For at least three of the 6 not-found entries, a real project doing exactly
# the described job exists UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME. That reads as garbled
# recall, not invention, and the remedy differs: search for the capability, do
# not conclude the capability is imaginary. So an UNVERIFIED verdict must be
# worded as an absence on ONE SEARCH PATH; a non-existence claim is refused.
#
# ── Why the sweep precondition is checked FIRST (FR-021) ────────────────────
# A missing sweep result is NOT "no findings". That is the same false-null this
# whole feature exists to close (§11.4.201(6)): a broken instrument and a clean
# tree return the identical quiet zero.
