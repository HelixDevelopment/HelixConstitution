# instrument_trap_scan.sh — matchers for the five MEASURED instrument-trap
# classes (T220, §11.4.201(7)(c) "the path is part of the instrument").
#
# ── Why this exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Each class below returns a CLEAN, CONFIDENT, WRONG answer without crashing.
# That is what makes them invisible to every other layer: §11.4.1's script-bug
# clause only catches a crash, and §11.4.67's parse check only reads the file at
# parse time. Nothing in the toolchain notices an instrument that silently could
# not see, so it has to be matched for by name.
#
# ── The five classes, each MEASURED on this host ─────────────────────────────
#   trap_pipeline_exit_status     `( exit 1 ) | cat; echo $?` -> 0. The rc
#                                 belongs to the LAST stage, so a probe piped
#                                 into a pager reports the PAGER's success.
#                                 Countermeasure: capture the rc from the
#                                 command itself, or read PIPESTATUS.
#   trap_relative_date_predicate  /usr/bin/find is bfs 4.1.1 here:
#                                 `-newermt '-1 day'` -> rc=1 "Invalid
#                                 timestamp"; behind `2>/dev/null | wc -l` that
#                                 reads as 0 and "nothing changed" is believed.
#                                 Countermeasure: an ABSOLUTE timestamp.
#   trap_inverted_match           `grep -qv alpha f` -> rc=1 on a file that DOES
#                                 hold a non-matching line. -q + -v reports the
#                                 wrong status whenever any line matches.
#                                 Countermeasure: `grep -cv` + a COUNT compare.
#   trap_query_class_mismatch     a bare-literal needle crosses fewer layers
#                                 than an ERE query, so it certifies a zero the
#                                 query never really searched for
#                                 (§11.4.201(7)(b)). Countermeasure: a needle
#                                 carrying the query's load-bearing features.
#   trap_greedy_display_transform a `sed` capture that is a bare `.*` spans past
#                                 the next literal, merging two tokens on one
#                                 line into one. Countermeasure: a character
#                                 class that cannot cross the delimiter.
#
# ── Output contract (T220) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Every finding carries the CLASS ID and the OFFENDING LINE, never a bare
# boolean, so a finding is diagnosable in one step:
#     FINDING <class_id> <file>:<lineno> <line text>
#
# ── False positives are refusals (§11.4.201(1)) ──────────────────────────────
# The GOOD half of the fixture set is not decoration. A scanner that fires on
# the countermeasure is a false-refusal engine, and the first thing a team does
# with a scanner that cries wolf is switch it off. Every matcher below is
# therefore paired with the countermeasure it must NOT fire on, and comment
# lines are skipped: a comment that DESCRIBES a trap is a CARRIER, not the trap
# (§11.4.201(7)(a)) — this very file would otherwise flag itself.
#
# ── This scanner obeys its own rules ─────────────────────────────────────────
# It uses index()/substr() rather than a greedy `sub(/^.*-newermt.*/, ...)` to
# read the -newermt argument, because using a greedy transform inside the
# matcher for greedy transforms would reproduce class 5 in the code meant to
# detect it.
#
# Usage : . constitution/scripts/gates/lib/instrument_trap_scan.sh
#         its_scan_file <file>          -> prints FINDING lines; rc 0 clean, 1 findings
#         its_class_ids                 -> the closed class-id set, one per line
#         sh instrument_trap_scan.sh --selftest
# Deps  : POSIX sh, awk, grep.
