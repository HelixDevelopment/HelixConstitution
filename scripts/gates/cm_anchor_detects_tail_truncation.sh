# cm_anchor_detects_tail_truncation.sh — CM-ANCHOR-DETECTS-TAIL-TRUNCATION (T328)
#
# ── What this gate asserts ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
# T328: "asserts chain-alone PASS **and** chain-plus-anchor DETECTED on the
#        truncated fixture, and asserts the lagging-anchor negative control
#        still PASSes so the gate cannot false-refuse a healthy chain."
#
# The PAIR of verdicts is the whole point. Tail truncation leaves behind a
# structurally VALID chain — contiguous sequence numbers, every prev_digest
# matching its predecessor — so chain-alone verification PASSes it, and that
# PASS is a MEASURED FACT, not a defect to be fixed. Only the external record of
# the expected head and entry count catches it. Asserting both halves together
# is therefore the evidence that the ANCHOR, and not the chain, carries this
# property; a gate that asserted only "DETECTED somewhere" could not tell which
# layer did the work.
#
# ── The false-refusal half is equally load-bearing ───────────────────────────
# A LAGGING anchor — one taken when the chain was shorter, with valid appends
# since — is HEALTHY. A head-digest-EQUALITY check collapses the lagging anchor
# and the truncated chain into one verdict, condemning healthy work; that is a
# §11.4.201(1) FAIL-bluff exactly as serious as a false pass, because it teaches
# people to ignore the verifier, which is how a real detection later gets waved
# through. So the negative control is a hard assertion here, not a comment.
#
# ── Checks (machine-readable `RESULT <id> <verdict>` lines) ──────────────────
#   golden-TRUE  (the property this gate exists to prove):
#     B1  truncated fixture: chain_alone   == PASS      (chain alone is blind)
#     B2  truncated fixture: chain_plus_anchor == DETECTED, seam exits 3
#     B3  both halves are present as DISTINCT fields and actually DIFFER here
#   golden-FALSE (a clean state MUST NOT make the gate fire — §11.4.201(1)):
#     B4  lagging-anchor negative control: BOTH halves PASS, seam exits 0
#     B5  golden-good (anchor == chain exactly): BOTH halves PASS, seam exits 0
#     B7  CARRIER: the seam's own usage text contains the literal `DETECTED`,
#         yet a structural read of the negative-control run yields PASS — the
#         token is not the thing (§11.4.201(7)(a)). A gate that grepped the
#         stream for `DETECTED` would fire on a healthy chain.
#   corpus honesty:
#     B6  the OBSERVED verdicts match the fixture corpus's own DECLARED intent
#         (`chain_alone_detects` / `anchor_detects` in intent.json), so a corpus
#         that silently stopped being a truncation cannot pass vacuously
#
# ── Control needles (§11.4.201(7)(b)) ────────────────────────────────────────
#   N1  the verdict reader is shown reading `DETECTED` through the SAME jq path
#       (out of the truncation report) BEFORE B4/B5 are allowed to report that
#       the healthy runs carry no DETECTED. A zero from a blind reader is
#       reported as INSTRUMENT BLIND (exit 4 REFUSE), never as a clean result.
#   N2  the runner is shown observing a NON-zero exit through the same
#       invocation path before any "exit was 0" claim is trusted.
#
# The shared needle helper for these gates is task T324
# (`constitution/scripts/gates/lib/chain_control_needle.sh`). It was ABSENT when
# this gate was written (measured), and §11.4.251 forbids landing a second
# near-identical copy, so both needles are INLINE here and are owed a migration
# onto that helper once its contract lands. This gate does NOT create that file.
#
# ── Usage ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   cm_anchor_detects_tail_truncation.sh [--engine <dir>] [--quiet]
#
# ── Exit codes ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   0 PASS | 1 FAIL | 4 REFUSE (could not decide — never 0, §11.4.201(6))
#
# ── Side-effects ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   Writes ONLY under a private mktemp -d, removed on exit. Builds the engine's
#   seam with `go build -o <tmp>` and its fixture generator from a throwaway
#   module in that tmp dir which `replace`s the module path to --engine, so the
#   code under test is the real in-repo source and the repo is never written to.
#
# ── Dependencies ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   POSIX sh, go, jq. Any absent -> REFUSE with the reason named.
#
# ── Paired §1.1 mutation ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   cm_anchor_detects_tail_truncation_mutation_test.sh (task T332)
