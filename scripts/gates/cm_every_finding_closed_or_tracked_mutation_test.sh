# cm_every_finding_closed_or_tracked_mutation_test.sh — §1.1 paired mutation
# test for cm_every_finding_closed_or_tracked.sh (§11.4.261(D) —
# CM-EVERY-FINDING-CLOSED-OR-TRACKED).
#
# ── Purpose ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Proves the gate is genuinely load-bearing (§1.1): golden-good PASSes, each
# distinct violation class correctly FAILs with the right reason, restore
# PASSes again (the gate re-evaluates live), and a false-positive guard is
# exercised (a genuinely-empty/absent ledger — the target "zero findings
# outstanding" state — MUST PASS vacuously, never mis-reported as a defect).
# All work happens in a disposable mktemp -d scratch tree (§11.4.84 — never
# the real working tree).
#
# ── Sub-cases ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   T1  — golden-GOOD (one tracked row with tracker_ref+mitigation_evidence,
#         one closed row with mitigation_evidence) PASSES.
#   T2  — mutation: a row with status="open" -> FAILs reason=FINDING_STILL_OPEN.
#   T3  — restore -> PASSES again.
#   T4  — mutation: a tracked row with empty tracker_ref ->
#         FAILs reason=TRACKED_MISSING_FIELDS.
#   T5  — restore.
#   T6  — mutation: a closed row with no mitigation_evidence field at all ->
#         FAILs reason=CLOSED_MISSING_MITIGATION_EVIDENCE.
#   T7  — restore.
#   T8  — mutation: a row with an unrecognised status value ("wontfix") ->
#         FAILs reason=UNRECOGNISED_OR_MISSING_STATUS.
#   T9  — restore.
#   T10 — FALSE-POSITIVE GUARD: the ledger file does not exist at all (the
#         genuinely-clean, zero-findings-outstanding target state) -> the
#         gate MUST NOT fire — it PASSES vacuously, exactly as a "nothing to
#         disposition" state deserves (§11.4.201(1) — a false refusal on a
#         legitimately-empty/absent case is a FAIL-bluff of equal severity
#         to a false pass).
#   T11 — restore (recreate the golden-good ledger) -> PASSES again, proving
#         the gate is not "stuck" from the absent-ledger case.
#
# ── Usage ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   cm_every_finding_closed_or_tracked_mutation_test.sh
#
# ── Exit codes ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   0 — every sub-case behaved as required (gate is genuinely load-bearing).
#   1 — at least one sub-case behaved incorrectly (gate is decoration or broken).
#
# Classification: universal (§11.4.17).
