# cm_canonical_root_clarity.sh — CM-CANONICAL-ROOT-CLARITY gate (§11.4.35).
#
# ── Purpose ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# §11.4.35 (Canonical-root inheritance clarity) fixes the DIRECTION of
# inheritance: the constitution submodule's three files
# (`Constitution.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`) ARE the canonical root —
# they are the SOURCE of inheritance and are never themselves consumers —
# while the consuming project's repo-root `CLAUDE.md` is the CONSUMER and
# MUST open with an inheritance pointer back to that root.
#
# The anchor names this gate and states its contract verbatim
# (constitution/Constitution.md, the "Pre-build gate (recommended, per
# consuming project)" block under §11.4.35):
#
#     CM-CANONICAL-ROOT-CLARITY — verifies (a) consumer's CLAUDE.md opens
#     with the inheritance pointer (either @import or
#     `## INHERITED FROM constitution/CLAUDE.md` heading), (b) the
#     constitution submodule's three files are present at the expected path,
#     (c) no `## INHERITED FROM` block in the constitution submodule's own
#     files (those ARE the source-of-truth, not consumers).
#
# This script implements exactly those three invariants. It invents no
# requirement the anchor does not state.
#
# ── Why (c) matters (the real hole this closes) ─────────────────────────────
# If a canonical-root file ever acquires a live inheritance pointer, the
# inheritance direction silently INVERTS: the source-of-truth starts
# declaring itself a downstream consumer of something else. Every
# "the constitution wins" precedence claim in every consumer then rests on a
# file that says it is inheriting. Nothing else in the corpus checks this —
# the propagation gates check that anchors are PRESENT in the mirrors, never
# that the canonical root has not become a consumer.
#
# ── The CARRIER problem this gate is built around (§11.4.201(7)(a)) ─────────
# `constitution/CLAUDE.md` LEGITIMATELY contains the line
#     ## INHERITED FROM constitution/CLAUDE.md
# inside a ```markdown fenced code block, in its "How inheritance works"
# section: it is DOCUMENTING the pointer a consumer must write. That is a
# CARRIER that MENTIONS the pointer, not a live pointer.
#
# MEASURED FACT (2026-08-23, this corpus): the naive line-anchored query
# `grep -cE '^## INHERITED FROM' constitution/CLAUDE.md` returns **1**; the
# same query run through this gate's fence-stripper returns **0**. A gate
# built on the naive query would therefore REFUSE a perfectly correct
# canonical root — the false-positive refusal §11.4.201(1) classes as a
# FAIL-bluff, exactly as forbidden as a false pass. So every match in this
# gate is taken AFTER fenced code blocks are blanked out.
#
# Blockquoted and indented mentions need no special handling: the `^`
# anchor already excludes `> ## INHERITED FROM` and 4-space-indented forms,
# both of which are quotations, never live headings.
#
# ── The control needle (§11.4.201(7)(b)) ────────────────────────────────────
# Invariant (c) reports an ABSENCE, and a null is not evidence until the
# instrument is proven able to see. Before trusting any zero, this gate runs
# a CLASS-MATCHED needle through the SAME instrument and the SAME path: the
# certified query is a fence-stripped, line-anchored `## `-heading match, so
# the needle is a fence-stripped, line-anchored `## `-heading match for a
# heading known to be present (`^## [A-Z]`), and it MUST return non-zero on
# every audited file. A bare-literal needle would certify only the layers a
# bare literal crosses; this one carries the anchoring AND the fence-stripped
# path, which are the load-bearing features of the real query. A paired
# negative control (a heading string nobody wrote) MUST return zero, so a
# match-everything instrument is caught too. Needle absent ⇒ BLIND (exit 2),
# never a reported absence.
#
# ── Usage ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   cm_canonical_root_clarity.sh [--const-dir <dir>] [--consumer-root <dir>]
#                                [--head-lines N] [--quiet]
#   cm_canonical_root_clarity.sh --selftest
#
#     --const-dir <dir>      canonical-root directory holding the three files
#                            (default: CANONICAL_ROOT_DIR env, else this
#                            script's own ../.. — i.e. the constitution
#                            submodule root when the gate runs from
#                            <const>/scripts/gates/).
#     --consumer-root <dir>  consuming project root holding the consumer
#                            CLAUDE.md (default: CONSUMER_ROOT env, else the
#                            parent directory of --const-dir).
#     --head-lines N         how many leading lines of the consumer CLAUDE.md
#                            count as "opens with" (default 40). The pointer
#                            follows the file's title//description lines in
#                            practice, so "opens with" is a head WINDOW, not
#                            literally line 1.
#     --quiet                suppress per-check PASS lines (FAIL always shown).
#     --selftest             run the golden-good / golden-bad / negative-
#                            control fixture suite against this gate itself
#                            and exit (no real tree is read).
#
# ── Inputs ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   CANONICAL_ROOT_DIR / CONSUMER_ROOT env overrides (flags take precedence).
#   No consuming project's paths are hardcoded — every path is derived from
#   this script's own location or supplied as DATA (§11.4.28 / §11.4.35 /
#   §11.4.177).
#
# ── Outputs ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   Per-check PASS/FAIL lines on stdout + a final verdict line.
#
# ── Side-effects ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   None on the real tree (read-only; no network, no commit, no device).
#   `--selftest` creates and removes its own `mktemp -d` scratch fixtures.
#
# ── Dependencies ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   POSIX sh, awk, grep, sed, mktemp. Parses clean under bash -n AND sh -n
#   (§11.4.67); no arrays, no `[[`, no `mapfile`. No command-less `exec`
#   redirection anywhere (§11.4.67(6)).
#
# ── Cross-references ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   §11.4.35 (this gate's mandate + verbatim contract), §11.4.17 (the
#   universal-vs-project classification §11.4.35 defines the layers for),
#   §11.4.201(1) (a false-positive refusal is a FAIL-bluff — hence the
#   fence-stripper), §11.4.201(7)(a) (carrier vs thing), §11.4.201(7)(b)
#   (control needle before any reported absence), §11.4.201(7)(c) (the path
#   is part of the instrument — no verdict is ever taken from a pipeline's
#   exit status), §11.4.227(A) (a named gate must land a SEAM, not prose),
#   §1.1 (paired mutation: cm_canonical_root_clarity_mutation_test.sh).
#
# ── Exit codes ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   0 — invariants (a), (b), (c) all hold.
#   1 — at least one invariant violated.
#   2 — BLIND / environment error: a required directory or file is
#       unreadable, or the control needle failed (the instrument cannot see,
#       so no absence it reports may be trusted — §11.4.6, never a guessed
#       zero).
#
# Classification: universal (§11.4.17) — no project-specific literal; the
# consuming project supplies --const-dir / --consumer-root as DATA (§11.4.35).
