# cm_zero_findings_monotone_ratchet_mutation_test.sh — §1.1 paired mutation
# test for cm_zero_findings_monotone_ratchet.sh (§11.4.261(C) —
# CM-ZERO-FINDINGS-MONOTONE-RATCHET).
#
# ── Purpose ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Proves the gate is genuinely load-bearing (§1.1): golden-good PASSes, each
# distinct violation class correctly FAILs with the right reason, restore
# PASSes again, and a false-positive guard is exercised (a live count
# EXACTLY EQUAL to its ratchet ceiling MUST PASS — the invariant is <=, not
# <; a gate that refuses on equality is a FAIL-bluff, §11.4.201(1)). All work
# happens in a disposable mktemp -d scratch tree (§11.4.84).
#
# ── Sub-cases ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   T1 — golden-GOOD (every class's live count strictly under its ceiling)
#        PASSES.
#   T2 — mutation: add findings so one class's live count EXCEEDS its
#        ceiling -> FAILs reason=RATCHET_EXCEEDED.
#   T3 — restore -> PASSES again.
#   T4 — mutation: a finding of a class with NO ratchet-snapshot entry at all
#        -> FAILs reason=UNRATCHETED_CLASS_PRESENT (implicit ceiling 0).
#   T5 — restore.
#   T6 — mutation: the ratchet-snapshot file is deleted entirely ->
#        FAILs reason=RATCHET_SNAPSHOT_MISSING (a hard FAIL, never BLIND).
#   T7 — restore.
#   T8 — FALSE-POSITIVE GUARD: a class's live count is set EXACTLY EQUAL to
#        its ratchet ceiling -> the gate MUST PASS (the invariant is <=, not
#        <; refusing on exact equality would be a FAIL-bluff §11.4.201(1)).
#   T9 — restore -> PASSES again (gate not stuck after the boundary case).
#
# ── Usage ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   cm_zero_findings_monotone_ratchet_mutation_test.sh
#
# ── Exit codes ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   0 — every sub-case behaved as required (gate is genuinely load-bearing).
#   1 — at least one sub-case behaved incorrectly (gate is decoration or broken).
#
# Classification: universal (§11.4.17).
