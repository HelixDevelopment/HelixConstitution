# cm_anchor_record_complete_mutation_test.sh — paired §1.1 mutation for T327
# (task T331), covering gate CM-ANCHOR-RECORD-COMPLETE.
#
# ── What this proves ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# T331: "defaults `anchor_strength` to `mechanism` with no probe evidence, and
#        separately drops `entry_count`, asserting the gate FAILs on each."
#
# A gate's passes do not count until a mutation has been OBSERVED making it
# fail (§11.4.115(F)). This script mutates the SHIPPED mechanism — not the
# gate, and not the gate's fixtures — in an OUT-OF-REPO COPY (§11.4.84), and
# asserts the gate turns red for the RIGHT check.
#
# ── The two mutations ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   M1  pkg/anchor/strength.go — ProbeStrength's nil-probe branch returns
#       {PASS, mechanism} instead of {SKIP, unknown}: the strongest claim is
#       now the DEFAULT, reached with no probe behind it. This is the exact
#       theatre §11.4.6 forbids ("policy-forbidden is not mechanically-
#       prevented"), and the gate must catch it.
#         MUST flip to FAIL : A2_unprobed_strength_is_unknown
#                             A9_unprobed_mechanism_refused
#         MUST remain PASS  : A8_probe_verified_mechanism_accepted
#       That last one is the point of the specificity assertion: a mutation
#       that reddened the whole gate would be indistinguishable from one that
#       broke it, and a gate that refuses everything is useless (§11.4.201(1)).
#
#   M2  pkg/anchor/anchor.go — Validate stops refusing EntryCount <= 0, so an
#       anchor may be recorded with no count. head_digest alone makes WHOLESALE
#       DELETION silent (there is no head left to compare), and the count is
#       what turns that silence into a detected absence.
#         MUST flip to FAIL : A12b_missing_entry_count_refused
#                             A5a_missing_entry_count_refused
#         MUST remain PASS  : A12a_complete_record_accepted
#                             A12c_missing_head_digest_refused
#
# ── Why this is not a tautology (§11.4.115(F)) ───────────────────────────────
# Neither mutation deletes a string the gate greps for. Both change BEHAVIOUR:
# M1 changes what the seam WRITES into an anchor record, M2 changes what the
# shipped validator ACCEPTS. The gate notices because it reads the record and
# drives the validator, not because a literal vanished.
#
# ── Anti-bluff on the mutation itself ────────────────────────────────────────
#   * every mutation is applied to a COPY under mktemp -d; the repository is
#     never written to, and that is proven by a checksum of the source tree
#     taken before and after the whole run;
#   * a mutation whose diff changed NOTHING is refused as a tautology (the
#     checksum of the copy must move, and the mutated text must be present);
#   * the BASELINE must be green before any mutation is applied — a mutation
#     test run against a red baseline proves nothing;
#   * restoration is verified by checksum, and the final run re-proves the gate
#     green on the restored tree.
