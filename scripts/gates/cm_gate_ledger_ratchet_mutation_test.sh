# cm_gate_ledger_ratchet_mutation_test.sh — §1.1 paired mutation test for
# CM-GATE-LEDGER-RATCHET (§11.4.227(A)).
#
# ── Purpose ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Proves the ratchet gate is genuinely load-bearing, not a tautology:
#   T1 (golden-TRUE)  — the REAL constitution tree, as committed, PASSes.
#   T2 (mutation)     — naming a brand-new CM-* gate in the corpus with
#                       NEITHER an implementation NOR a registered deferral
#                       MUST make the gate FAIL (unimplemented count exceeds
#                       the checked-in baseline by exactly one).
#   T3 (restore-by-deferral) — registering a deferral for that SAME new gate
#                       (still no implementation) MUST restore PASS (the
#                       gate moves from UNIMPLEMENTED to DEFERRED, so the
#                       ratchet-counted bucket returns to baseline).
#   T4 (vanished-name mutation) — deleting EVERY occurrence of a real,
#                       previously-named gate from the corpus WITHOUT adding
#                       a removal citation MUST make the gate FAIL.
#   T5 (restore-by-removal-citation) — adding that removal citation MUST
#                       restore PASS.
#
# All five run against a disposable scratch COPY of the real tree (never the
# live working tree — §11.4.84 quiescence; a mutation test must never leave
# residue in the checkout it is verifying).
#
# ── Usage ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# ── Exit codes ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   0 — all five sub-cases behaved as required (the gate is proven
#       load-bearing).
#   1 — at least one sub-case did not behave as required.
#
# Classification: universal (§11.4.17).

# `mktemp -d` copy has no index, which the engine correctly refuses as BLIND.
# `git add -A` alone is enough: tracked-ness is read from the INDEX, so no
# commit — and therefore no user identity — is required. Every mutation below

# committed baseline was last regenerated (this repo's own CM-* gate count
# moves as new gates land — the checked-in baseline is a monotone-decrease
# RATCHET, not necessarily equal to "right now" between landings).
