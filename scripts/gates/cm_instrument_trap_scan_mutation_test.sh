# cm_instrument_trap_scan_mutation_test.sh — paired §1.1 mutation for
# CM-INSTRUMENT-TRAP-SCAN (T231; the mutation T215 names).
#
# ── The mutation ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Disable ONE class matcher (trap_greedy_display_transform) in an out-of-repo copy of
# constitution/scripts/gates/lib/instrument_trap_scan.sh, then assert that
# scripts/testing/anti_slop/us2_trap_scan_red.sh FAILs and that it misses
# EXACTLY that fixture — the other four classes must still be flagged, which is
# what makes the flip attributable to this matcher and not to general breakage
# (§11.4.194(6)(d)).
#
# ── Why class 5 and not class 3 ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# The gate's own control needle is a class-3 (trap_inverted_match) fixture, so
# removing class 3 blinds the scanner entirely and it correctly refuses to
# report on ANY file. That is right behaviour but a useless mutation: every
# fixture would fail and the flip would prove nothing about one matcher. Class 5
# is outside the needle's path, so the scanner stays sighted and misses EXACTLY
# the one fixture — which is what T215 asks this mutation to demonstrate.
#
# ── Why the matcher is EDITED rather than switched off ──────────────────────
# The library carries no env-var suppression knob, on purpose: a scanner that
# can be blinded by an environment variable IS the defect it exists to detect.
# So the mutation edits code, which is also what §11.4.115(F) requires — a
# mutation that only deletes the literal strings the gate greps for is a
# refused tautology.
#
# ── Single-resource-owner (§11.4.84) ────────────────────────────────────────
# Everything runs in an out-of-repo mktemp -d staged with the SAME directory
# depth as the repository, so the gate under test resolves its own libraries
# and fixtures exactly as the tracked one does. The tracked library is never
# edited; its sha256 is compared before and after.
#
# Usage : sh cm_instrument_trap_scan_mutation_test.sh   (rc 0 = pair valid)
