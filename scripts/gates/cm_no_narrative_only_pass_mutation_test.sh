# cm_no_narrative_only_pass_mutation_test.sh — §1.1 paired mutation test for
# cm_no_narrative_only_pass.sh (§11.4.262(C) — CM-NO-NARRATIVE-ONLY-PASS).
#
# ── Purpose ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Proves the gate is genuinely load-bearing (§1.1): golden-good PASSes, each
# distinct violation class correctly FAILs with the right reason, restore
# PASSes again, and a false-positive guard is exercised (a report containing
# ONLY the substring "PASSWORD" -- never a standalone "PASS" token -- MUST
# NOT be mis-flagged as a narrative-PASS-claim bluff; a word-boundary miss
# would be a §11.4.201(1) FAIL-bluff). All work happens in a disposable
# mktemp -d scratch tree (§11.4.84).
#
# ── Sub-cases ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   T1 — golden-GOOD (a free-text report whose PASS claim cites a nearby
#        evidence: line, plus a JSON report auto-OK'd) PASSES.
#   T2 — mutation: the free-text report's evidence: citation is removed ->
#        FAILs reason=NARRATIVE_PASS_NO_EVIDENCE.
#   T3 — restore -> PASSES again.
#   T4 — mutation: the manifest declares a report path that does not exist
#        -> FAILs reason=DECLARED_REPORT_MISSING.
#   T5 — restore.
#   T6 — FALSE-POSITIVE GUARD: a declared report contains ONLY the substring
#        "PASSWORD" (repeatedly, in several sentences) and NEVER a
#        standalone word-boundary "PASS" token -> the gate MUST NOT fire
#        (word-boundary match, not substring match).
#   T7 — restore -> PASSES again (gate not stuck).
#
# ── Usage ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   cm_no_narrative_only_pass_mutation_test.sh
#
# ── Exit codes ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   0 — every sub-case behaved as required (gate is genuinely load-bearing).
#   1 — at least one sub-case behaved incorrectly (gate is decoration or broken).
#
# Classification: universal (§11.4.17).
