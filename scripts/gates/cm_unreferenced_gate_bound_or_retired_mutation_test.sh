# cm_unreferenced_gate_bound_or_retired_mutation_test.sh — §1.1 paired mutation
# for CM-UNREFERENCED-GATE-BOUND-OR-RETIRED.
#
# ── Cases ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   NEG  NEGATIVE CONTROL — a fixture set in which every gate is bound or
#        cited-retired MUST pass. Without this, a sweep that refused
#        unconditionally would score full marks on every other case.
#
#   M1   STRIP THE RETIREMENT CITATION from a removals row.
#        Clean: ALLOW. Mutated: REFUSE naming the citation.
#        This is the anti-gaming clause under test: without a CHECKED
#        citation, "retire the name" becomes a way to lower the unimplemented
#        count without doing the work — the delete-names-to-lower-the-count
#        channel §11.4.227(A) exists to close.
#
#   M2   ADD A FIXTURE GATE carrying neither a wiring record nor a
#        retirement record. Mutated: REFUSE, NAMING it.
#
#   M3   SOURCE MUTATION on an OUT-OF-REPO COPY: neutralise the citation
#        VALIDATION so any row counts as retired. M1's fixture must then STOP
#        refusing. This is the anti-tautology proof — it shows M1's flip is
#        produced by the citation check itself and not by some neighbouring
#        assertion that happens to fire on the same fixture (the FINDINGS.md
#        F-002-02 failure mode, where a mutation renamed a reason token while
#        the mechanism survived).
#
# ── §11.4.84 working-tree quiescence ─────────────────────────────────────────
# Nothing in the repository is mutated. Data mutations land in a mktemp dir;
# the source mutation is applied to a COPY placed outside the repository. The
# real gate is checksummed before and after and the equality asserted.
#
# ── Exit codes ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   0 — every mutation flipped its NAMED assertion, the negative control
#       passed, and the gate file is unchanged.
#   1 — a mutation did not flip, flipped the wrong assertion, the negative
#       control fired, or the gate file changed.
#   2 — the harness could not run.
#
# Classification: universal (§11.4.17).
