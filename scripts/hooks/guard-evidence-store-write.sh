# guard-evidence-store-write.sh — PreToolUse guard: a PRODUCER may not write the
# evidence/verdict store directly (T122, spec 002; FR-031 / FR-008, layer 1).
#
# §11.4.69 FEATURE: permission_grant
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT THIS IS — and, stated first because it is the honest part, WHAT IT IS NOT
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This is BEST-EFFORT PREVENTION, layered UNDER the reader-side detection in
# scripts/lib/critical_blocker_gate.sh (T118). It is NEVER a substitute for it.
#
# THE MEASURED BYPASS, NAMED HERE RATHER THAN IMPLIED AWAY (§11.4.6):
#   A Write/Edit matcher sees Write and Edit tool calls. ONE LEVEL OF
#   INDIRECTION defeats it entirely — a Bash call that appends (`printf … >>
#   store`), a helper script, a symlink, an editor invoked through a shell —
#   none of those present as a Write to the store path, and none of them is
#   blocked here. Research D-3 measured exactly this: a satisfy row forged by a
#   single plain `>>` redirection bypassed the append function and was accepted
#   with rc=0.
#
#   That is WHY the guarantee lives in the READER. T118 checks authorship on
#   every READ, so a forged row is caught no matter how it was written. This
#   hook only raises the cost of the most direct path. A bypass that is NAMED is
#   a stated limit; a bypass that is implied away is a bluff — and the test
#   suite (test_guard_evidence_store_write.sh) ASSERTS this bypass still
#   succeeds, so the coverage claim is a measured fact rather than a hope.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE RULE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   BLOCK (exit 2) a Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit whose target is in the
#   evidence-store path class WHEN the harness-supplied session id is recorded
#   as a PRODUCER for some item in that store.
#   ALLOW (exit 0) everything else — a non-producer session, a path outside the
#   class, a non-write tool. A false-positive block is rated exactly as
#   seriously as a false pass (§11.4.201(1)): this hook sits on the operator's
#   working path, and one that blocks legitimate edits gets switched off, taking
#   the real coverage with it.
#   FAIL CLOSED (exit 2) when the registry cannot be read: with no way to
#   establish who the producer is, an authorization surface refuses (§11.4.252).
#
# Configuration (consumer DATA, never hardcoded logic):
#   GESW_REGISTRY  — evidence store to consult. Default: the repo's
#                    docs/requests/critical_blockers.jsonl.
#
# Contract: stdin = the PreToolUse JSON payload; exit 0 = allow, 2 = block.
