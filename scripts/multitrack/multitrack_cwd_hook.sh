# multitrack_cwd_hook.sh
#
# Purpose:
#   The thin, project-specific adapter that the (generic) Claude-Toolkit `cma_run`
#   wrapper invokes on every alias session start to learn WHICH directory the
#   alias should work in. Given the alias label (claude1/claude2/claude3) it
#   prints the alias's bound track worktree (/mnt/trackN/<project>) on stdout,
#   or prints NOTHING when there is no valid worktree — in which case `cma_run`
#   leaves the session in the shared /home checkout (safe fallback).
#
#   This is the "hook" half of the permanent multi-track switch. The toolkit
#   knows nothing about tracks/<project>; it only `cd`s into whatever real
#   directory this hook prints (see cma_run's CMA_CWD_HOOK integration).
#
#   Contract with the toolkit (MUST stay stable):
#     * invoked as:   claude-cwd-hook <alias-label>
#     * on success:   print ONE absolute directory path on stdout, exit 0
#     * otherwise:    print nothing (any exit) -> toolkit stays on /home
#     * MUST be fast, read-only, and NEVER hang/fail a session.
#
# Usage:
#   multitrack_cwd_hook.sh <alias>          # hook mode: print worktree or nothing
#   multitrack_cwd_hook.sh --install        # symlink ~/.local/bin/claude-cwd-hook -> here
#   multitrack_cwd_hook.sh --uninstall      # remove that symlink (only if ours)
#   multitrack_cwd_hook.sh --status         # show symlink + per-alias resolution
#   multitrack_cwd_hook.sh --consumer-root [alias]
#                                           # diagnostic: print the resolved
#                                           # consumer project root + WHY
#   multitrack_cwd_hook.sh -h | --help
#
# Inputs (env):
#   MULTITRACK_DISABLE=1   Escape hatch: print nothing, exit 0 (switch off).
#   CMA_CWD_HOOK           (read by the toolkit) path the toolkit calls; --install
#                          points ~/.local/bin/claude-cwd-hook at this script.
#   MT_REPO_ROOT           Explicit consumer-project-root pin. Highest precedence
#                          (see the CONSUMER-ROOT RESOLUTION block below).
#   MT_CONSUMER_ROOTS      Path to the operator-owned alias->consumer-root binding
#                          file (default
#                          ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/multitrack/consumer_roots.conf).
#                          Consumer/operator DATA — never a project literal here.
#   (all resolver env vars are honored, e.g. MT_CONFIG_DIR / MT_ALIAS_DIR)
#   --- §11.4.119 checkout-owner advisory check (ATM-833) ---
#   MT_CHECKOUT_OWNER_POLICY   off | warn | enforce. Unset/unrecognised => the
#                              PERMISSIVE default `warn` (see below). `enforce`
#                              withholds the worktree on a contended checkout so
#                              the session stays where it is (it NEVER refuses a
#                              session — the toolkit simply does not `cd`).
#   MULTITRACK_AUTOMATED=1     An automated launcher DECLARING itself; selects
#                              `enforce` when no explicit policy is set. A human
#                              never sets it, so an interactive session is never
#                              silently redirected (§11.4.201 real-condition).
#   MT_CHECKOUT_OWNER_LOCK     Explicit path to the checkout-owner-lock tool
#                              (consumer DATA / testability). Otherwise resolved
#                              as a sibling of this script, then as
#                              <resolved-worktree>/$MT_CHECKOUT_OWNER_LOCK_RELPATH.
#   MT_CHECKOUT_OWNER_LOCK_RELPATH  default scripts/multitrack/multitrack_checkout_owner_lock.sh
#   MT_CHECKOUT_OWNER_LOG      Append-only advisory log (default
#                              ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-/tmp}/multitrack_checkout_owner_guard.log).
#   EVERY failure path of this check FAILS OPEN (tool absent / unreadable
#   registry / unwritable lock dir / crash / timeout => pre-existing behaviour).
#
# Outputs: stdout = one worktree path (hook mode) or human text (--status).
# Side-effects: --install/--uninstall create/remove ONE symlink under ~/.local/bin.
#               Hook mode: relays the resolver's worktree on stdout AND fires THREE
#               BEST-EFFORT, NON-FATAL, FULLY-DETACHED side-effects for the alias's
#               resolved track (all with all fds -> /dev/null before `&`, so NONE
#               can corrupt the single-line stdout NOR block the toolkit's

#                 (b) §4.2(C) monitor-auto-start (PWU-5) — one detached
#                     `multitrack_fallback_monitor.sh --daemon` per alias, tailing
#                     the alias's newest transcript for a rate-limit signature
#                     (idempotent: one monitor per alias/track);
#                 (c) §11.4.35 constitution auto-sync — one detached
#                     `multitrack_constitution_sync.sh for-alias A` that ancestor-
#                     guarded fast-forwards the worktree's constitution submodule
#                     to latest <remote>/main (ff-only, WIP-preserving, never
#                     force/reset — "always up to date with main, Everywhere!").
#               The conductor alias resolves to no track and is therefore NEVER
#               bound, NEVER monitored, and NEVER synced (same no-track path as
#               role:main — its /home checkout is kept current by its own workflow).

# §11.4.177 CONSUMER-ROOT RESOLUTION — which consumer project is this hook for?
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. Every other engine entry point runs from INSIDE a
# consumer checkout, so multitrack_config.sh:mt_repo_root's SELF-LOCATION
# (<engine>/../.. carrying config/multitrack, else the git superproject) is the
# right answer. This hook is the ONE entry point that runs from OUTSIDE any
# checkout — the toolkit invokes it only when cwd is NOT a git repo — and it is
# customarily installed ONCE on a shared PATH. Self-location therefore answers a
# question it cannot know: it returns whichever checkout physically holds the
# engine, SHADOWING every sibling consumer on the host that ships its own
# config/multitrack/ (the §11.4.177 re-coupling: one global entry point wired to
# one hardcoded project).
#
# PRECEDENCE (first hit wins; each step is a REAL, checkable condition —
# §11.4.201, never a guess):
#   1. MT_REPO_ROOT              explicit pin (operator / launcher / test seam)
#   2. invocation context        nearest ancestor of $PWD carrying
#                                config/multitrack/  (§11.4.177 "take the target
#                                from the invocation directory")
#   3. operator binding file     alias key, else `default` key, from a file
#                                OUTSIDE every checkout. HONEST BOUNDARY
#                                (§11.4.6): when the hook fires there is by
#                                construction NO cwd project context, so the
#                                alias->consumer mapping is host policy that
#                                nothing in-tree can derive. This minimal
#                                operator-owned artifact is the only way to
#                                satisfy §11.4.177 (project-agnostic tooling)
#                                and §11.4.187 (automatic, out-of-the-box)
#                                simultaneously.
#   4. NOTHING RESOLVED          export nothing -> the resolver falls back to its
#                                unchanged self-location behaviour. This is the
#                                load-bearing back-compat guarantee: a host with
#                                no binding file and no cwd context behaves
#                                EXACTLY as before this block existed, so no
#                                existing consumer of the engine can break.
#
# A candidate is accepted ONLY if it really carries config/multitrack/ — a stale
# or mistyped binding is REPORTED and IGNORED, never silently trusted (§11.4.6),
# and never fails the session (§11.4.187: the hook must never break a launch).
# NOTHING here writes to stdout: fd 1 is the toolkit's `cd` target.

# §11.4.119 CHECKOUT-OWNER ADVISORY CHECK (ATM-833) — the cwd-hook half.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The supervisor launch path takes a canonical, checkout-keyed owner lock; this
# (the toolkit-alias launch path) previously had NO lock / claim / ownership
# logic at all, so an alias session could join a checkout a supervisor already
# owned => two `claude` writers on ONE git index (§9.2 data-safety risk).
#
# ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINT — this code MUST NEVER prevent a session from starting.
#   * The toolkit consumes this hook as `cd "$(hook <alias>)" 2>/dev/null || true`
#     and only cd's when the printed path is a real directory. Printing NOTHING
#     therefore leaves the session on its current dir (/home) — the session
#     ALWAYS starts. There is no code path here that can refuse a shell.
#   * The only real hazard is HANGING (command substitution waits for us), so
#     every probe is NON-BLOCKING and, where `timeout` exists, hard-bounded.
#   * EVERY error path FAILS OPEN — unresolvable tool, unreadable registry,
#     unwritable lock dir, unexpected exit code, timeout => behave exactly as
#     before this section existed (print the worktree, no warning).
#
# POLICY (three-valued; see _cwh_owner_policy):
#   warn    (DEFAULT) — print the worktree as always, but emit a loud, evidence-
#                       bearing WARNING and skip the contended git-WRITE side
#                       effect (constitution auto-sync). An interactive human is
#                       NEVER silently redirected.
#   enforce           — additionally print NOTHING (session stays home) so the
#                       automated launcher does not become a 2nd writer.
#                       Selected ONLY by an explicit policy value or by an
