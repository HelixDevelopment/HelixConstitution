# test_multitrack_work_binding_submodule_db.sh — permanent §11.4.135 regression
# guard for multitrack_work_binding.sh's OWN submodule-cwd superproject-walk DB
# auto-discovery fix (this cycle).
#
# ── Forensic anchor (this fix, in-flight this cycle) ────────────────────────
#   multitrack_work_binding.sh's DB auto-discovery previously bound ONLY to
#   `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` (the innermost repo). A caller invoking the
#   resolver directly from INSIDE a submodule WITHOUT an explicit `--db` (e.g.
#   the detective gate CM-WORK-TRACK-BINDING-ENFORCED, or any other direct
#   caller that does not replicate the sibling guard hook's own submodule-aware
#   walk) unconditionally fail-closed BLOCKed, regardless of file-scope
#   classification, because `<submodule-root>/docs/workable_items.db` never
#   exists there — the real §11.4.93/§11.4.95 registry lives at the OUTERMOST
#   (super)project root. The fix teaches the resolver's OWN auto-discovery
#   (multitrack_work_binding.sh:129-197) to walk UP through every nested
#   `git rev-parse --show-superproject-working-tree` hop (depth-bounded to 10)
#   and probe each discovered outer root, OUTERMOST-first, mirroring the
#   sibling guard hook's `resolve_workable_items_db()`
#   (guard-work-track-binding.sh:179-205) — but landed INSIDE the shared
#   resolver itself, so every direct caller (not only the guard hook) benefits.
#
# ── What this suite proves (§11.4.115 RED->GREEN polarity + §11.4.6 anti-bluff) ──
#   (1) GREEN / direct regression case — an unclassified file, invoked from
#       cwd INSIDE a real `git submodule add`-created submodule, with $WI_DB
#       UNSET and NO --db, resolves the PARENT superproject's registry and
#       returns the correct verdict (exit 0), NOT a fail-closed "DB not found"
#       (exit 2).
#   (2) The parent DB is GENUINELY CONSULTED, not merely found-and-ignored — a
#       classified file (owned by a group whose canonical branch != the
#       change's declared branch) is still BLOCKED (exit 2) from submodule cwd,
#       and the SAME file with the CORRECT branch is ALLOWED (exit 0).
#   (3) Fail-closed is UNWEAKENED — the identical submodule-cwd invocation
#       against a fixture with NO workable-items DB anywhere in the git chain
#       still fail-closes (exit 2); the fix WIDENS discovery, it never
#       degrades the "unverifiable => BLOCK" guarantee (§11.4.6).
#   (4) RED-polarity self-check (§11.4.115) — a SCRATCHPAD-ONLY mutated copy of
#       the resolver with the superproject-walk block neutralised (the
#       pre-fix behaviour, byte-identical candidate list to before this cycle)
#       re-runs case (1) and MUST fail-closed (exit 2) — proving this guard
#       would catch a revert of the fix. The real, working-tree resolver is
#       NEVER modified; only a `mktemp`-created copy is mutated.
#
# This test is DISTINCT from the existing sibling suite
# constitution/scripts/hooks/test_guard_work_track_binding.sh §D: that suite
# exercises guard-work-track-binding.sh, which has its OWN
# `resolve_workable_items_db()` copy and ALWAYS supplies an explicit `--db` to
# the resolver once it finds one — so it never exercises the RESOLVER's own
# internal auto-discovery fallback path. This suite invokes
# multitrack_work_binding.sh DIRECTLY (no guard hook in the loop, no JSON
# payload), with $WI_DB unset and no --db, so the resolver's OWN walk is the
# only thing under test — the exact code path the detective gate
# CM-WORK-TRACK-BINDING-ENFORCED (and any other direct caller) depends on.
#
# Anti-bluff (§11.4.107(10) analogue): every fixture uses a REAL git submodule
# (`git submodule add`, own `.git` file + gitlink in the outer index — never a
# bare nested `git init`), a REAL schema-v4 sqlite registry (logic_groups +
# group_paths, mirroring the shape used by
# constitution/scripts/hooks/test_guard_work_track_binding.sh §D), and the
# mutation is verified to have actually landed (grep check) before being
# trusted as the RED baseline — a silently-no-op mutation would make the
# RED-polarity assertion vacuously true, which is itself the bluff §11.4.115
# forbids.
#
# Hermetic + self-cleaning: everything lives under one `mktemp -d`, removed via
# `trap ... EXIT` on every exit path. No project DB, no project git tree, no
# binary dependency.
#
# Usage: bash constitution/scripts/multitrack/test_multitrack_work_binding_submodule_db.sh
# Exit 0 = all cases pass (or hermetic SKIP); exit 1 = one or more cases failed.
#
# Cross-references: §11.4.191 (work-to-track/branch binding) · §11.4.135
