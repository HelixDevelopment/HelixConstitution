# test_multitrack_cwd_hook_consumer_root.sh — §11.4.177 consumer-root
#   resolution for the cwd-hook (the GLOBAL/shared entry point).
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
#   The cwd-hook is the ONE engine entry point that runs from OUTSIDE any
#   consumer checkout (the toolkit invokes it only when cwd is NOT a git repo).
#   Its consumer-project root was derived SOLELY from the engine script's own
#   file location (multitrack_config.sh:mt_repo_root steps (b)/(c)) — so a
#   globally-installed hook ALWAYS resolved to whichever checkout physically
#   holds the engine, SHADOWING every sibling consumer on the host that ships
#   its own config/multitrack/ (§11.4.177 re-coupling: one global entry point
#   hardcoded to one checkout).
#
#   Self-location is CORRECT for a repo-local invocation and MEANINGLESS for a
#   global one. This suite pins the corrected precedence for the global path:
#
#     1. MT_REPO_ROOT env pin              (explicit override — unchanged)
#     2. invocation context: nearest ancestor of $PWD with config/multitrack/
#     3. operator-owned binding file OUTSIDE any checkout (alias key, then
#        `default` key) — the minimal artifact, since with no cwd context the
#        alias->consumer mapping is host policy that NOTHING in-tree can know
#     4. nothing resolvable -> export NOTHING; the resolver behaves EXACTLY as
#        before (self-location) so no existing consumer changes behaviour
#
# Cases:
#   C1  binding names consumer B, engine lives in A          -> B   (RED->GREEN)
#   C2  no binding, neutral cwd                              -> A   (NEG CTRL)
#   C3  MT_REPO_ROOT pin wins over everything                -> B   (NEG CTRL)
#   C4  cwd inside consumer B, no binding                    -> B   (RED->GREEN)
#   C5  binding points at a NON-consumer path -> IGNORED     -> A   (§11.4.6)
#   C6  alias-specific key beats the `default` key           -> B
#   C7  stdout purity: hook mode emits EXACTLY one line            (contract)
#   C8  cwd inside consumer A (context agrees with self-loc) -> A   (NEG CTRL)
#
# Usage:   test_multitrack_cwd_hook_consumer_root.sh
# Inputs (env): none. Hermetic — every fixture lives under fresh mktemp dirs.
# Outputs: per-case PASS/FAIL lines; exit 0 iff every case passed.
# Side-effects: writes ONLY under its own temp dirs (removed on exit, §11.4.14).
#               NEVER touches $HOME, the operator PATH, or any real checkout.
# Dependencies: bash, git, findmnt, mktemp, hostname.
