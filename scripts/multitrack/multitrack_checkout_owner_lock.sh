# multitrack_checkout_owner_lock.sh — §11.4.119 SINGLE-RESOURCE-OWNER lock for a
#                                     TRACK CHECKOUT (the third resource class).
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
#   Guarantee that AT MOST ONE writing agent owns a given track checkout (git
#   worktree / working directory) at a time, ACROSS EVERY launch path — the
#   headless per-track supervisor, the interactive toolkit-alias/cwd-hook
#   session, an operator shell, or any future launcher.
#
#   The project already had exactly-once locks for the OTHER two resource
#   classes — `multitrack_claim.sh` (§11.4.176-A work ITEM) and
#   `multitrack_device_lock.sh` (§11.4.119 DEVICE) — but NOT for the CHECKOUT.
#   The supervisor's private `flock` guarded only its own launch path, so a
#   second agent arriving by a DIFFERENT path (the cwd-hook) shared one git
#   index/worktree with it (two writers => lost work / torn commit, §9.2).
#
# Forensic anchor (FACT, captured 2026-07-22, the-factory):
#   `fuser qa-results/multitrack/logs/track3.lock` listed ONLY the supervisor
#   and its descendants; the tmux/cwd-hook worker in the SAME checkout
#   (/mnt/track3/<project>-t3) held NO fd on it. Two live `claude` writers,
#   one checkout, zero shared lock. Same on track4.
#   Full diagnosis: docs/research/multitrack_duplicate_supervisors_20260722/
#                   DIAGNOSIS.md
#
# §11.4.111 RESOLVE-BY-STABLE-NAME (load-bearing):
#   The lock is keyed on the CANONICAL REAL PATH of the checkout, not on the
#   caller-supplied string and not on a track ORDINAL. On this host
#   `/mnt/track3/<project>` is a SYMLINK to `/mnt/track3/<project>-t3`; the
#   supervisor is launched with the former and the cwd-hook resolves to the
#   latter. A key derived from the raw string would mint TWO locks for ONE
#   checkout and refuse nothing — which is exactly the bug. `readlink -f`
#   collapses every alias onto one key. (The pre-existing supervisor lock was
#   keyed on the TRACK NUMBER, which is an ordinal — §11.4.111 forbids it.)
#
# §11.4.180 PROVABLY-STALE REAP (load-bearing):
#   The kernel releases a `flock` on holder death, so the LOCK itself never goes
#   stale. The holder METADATA file can, so `check` treats a recorded holder
#   whose PID is DEAD (`kill -0` fails) as STALE and reports the checkout FREE.
#   A LIVE holder is NEVER stolen, NEVER force-removed — liveness is PROVEN via
#   `kill -0`, never assumed (§11.4.6).
#
# §11.4.201 GUARD ASSERTS THE REAL CONDITION:
#   `check` reports BUSY only when the real `flock` cannot be taken. It never
#   infers ownership from a substring/process-name match (the §11.4.196(D) /
#   §12.12 carrier footgun that made a bare `pgrep` guard refuse every spawn).
#   Every refusal prints its resolved evidence (holder pid + label + realpath).
#
# Usage:
#   multitrack_checkout_owner_lock.sh lockfile <checkout>
#   multitrack_checkout_owner_lock.sh check    <checkout>
#   multitrack_checkout_owner_lock.sh run      <checkout> <owner-label> -- <cmd...>
#   multitrack_checkout_owner_lock.sh reap     <checkout>
#   multitrack_checkout_owner_lock.sh selfcheck
#   multitrack_checkout_owner_lock.sh -h|--help
#
# Inputs (env):
#   MT_CHECKOUT_LOCK_DIR   Lock directory (default:
#                          ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-/tmp}/multitrack_checkout_locks).
#                          Overridable for testability ONLY.
#
# Outputs / exit codes:
#   lockfile -> stdout: absolute lock path.                       exit 0
#   check    -> stdout: "FREE <realpath>"                          exit 0
#                       "BUSY <realpath> pid=<p> label=<l> since=<t>"  exit 3
#   run      -> runs <cmd...> holding the lock.  exit = cmd's exit
#                       refused (another live owner)                exit 3
#   reap     -> stdout: "REAPED <realpath> dead_pid=<p>" | "KEPT ..."  exit 0
#   selfcheck-> golden-good / golden-bad / negative-control oracle.  exit 0|1
#   usage error                                                     exit 2
#
# Side-effects: creates/updates the lock file + its `.holder` sidecar. NEVER
#   removes a lock held by a LIVE process. NEVER touches the checkout itself.

# §11.4.177 PROMOTION CANDIDATE: this file carries NO project literal (no

#   mechanism. It is a promotion candidate for
#   constitution/scripts/multitrack/. Landing it project-side first avoids a
