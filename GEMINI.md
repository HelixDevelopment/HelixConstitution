| Status summary | New Gemini CLI carrier of the Helix Constitution — added by §11.4.140 (universal action-prefix system) so Gemini CLI gets the LAYER-1 action-prefix recognition floor out of the box, plus the §11.4.141 token-efficiency mandate mirror. This file is one of the four canonical agent context carriers (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `QWEN.md`, `GEMINI.md`) the constitution maintains per §11.4.35; the textual identity of the action-prefix recognition block across all four IS the LAYER-1 universality. This GEMINI.md is a thin carrier — the full universal rule set is in `Constitution.md` (canonical) and the sibling carriers; Gemini CLI reads this file as its context carrier. |

## How inheritance works

This GEMINI.md is the **Gemini CLI carrier** of the Helix Constitution
submodule. It is one of the four canonical agent context carriers
(`constitution/CLAUDE.md`, `constitution/AGENTS.md`, `constitution/QWEN.md`,
`constitution/GEMINI.md`) — these ARE the canonical root per §11.4.35, NOT
consumer extensions. The full universal rule set lives in
`constitution/Constitution.md`; the sibling carriers (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`
/ `QWEN.md`) carry the same content for their respective agents. A consuming
project's own repo-root `GEMINI.md` (if any) opens with the inheritance pointer
and adds only project-specific rules; THIS file is the canonical carrier and
does not.

For agents driven from a consuming project, the project's repo-root carrier
SHOULD start with a clearly-marked inheritance pointer:

```markdown
## INHERITED FROM constitution/GEMINI.md

All rules in `constitution/GEMINI.md` (and the `constitution/Constitution.md`
it references) apply unconditionally. The project-specific rules below
extend them.
```

## Action-prefix recognition (§11.4.140 — LAYER-1)

The block below is the **canonical LAYER-1 action-prefix recognition
instruction**, embedded VERBATIM (identical text) into every agent context
carrier the constitution maintains. That textual identity across all four
carriers IS the LAYER-1 universality: Gemini CLI reads this block via this
carrier and applies the prefix expansion itself, so the action-prefix system
works on Gemini CLI with zero extra setup.

> **§11.4.140 — Universal action-prefix system (`ACTION_NAME ::`) (User mandate,
> 2026-06-09; GRAMMAR_ADDENDUM 2026-06-09).** When a user prompt's FIRST
> non-blank line starts with a recognised action prefix, you MUST: (1) look the
> action token up in the action registry
> `constitution/actions/registry.yaml` (or `$HELIX_ACTION_REGISTRY`);
> (2) if it is a registered action, REPLACE the prefix with that action's
> `expansion` text and apply its `rules`; (3) execute the remainder of the prompt
> under the expanded instruction. **Four EQUIVALENT forms** — same action, same
> expansion, same execution: (1) `ACTION_NAME :: <rest>` (bare `::`),
> (2) `PREFIX::ACTION_NAME :: <rest>` (namespaced `::`), (3) `/ACTION_NAME <rest>`
> (bare slash), (4) `/PREFIX::ACTION_NAME <rest>` (namespaced slash). Thus
> `BACKGROUND :: x` ≡ `DEFAULT::BACKGROUND :: x` ≡ `/BACKGROUND x` ≡
> `/DEFAULT::BACKGROUND x`. `PREFIX` is an action NAMESPACE; the reserved default
> namespace is **`DEFAULT`**, and an action runs WITH or WITHOUT the prefix.
> Grammar (all hold): anchored at the FIRST non-blank line only (mid-prose tokens
> never match); the action token AND the namespace are UPPERCASE-only
> `[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*` (lowercase never matches); the namespace separator `::`
> inside the token carries NO surrounding spaces (`PREFIX::ACTION_NAME`), DISTINCT
> from the action-body separator `" :: "` (one ASCII space on each side of `::` —
> avoids C++ `Foo::Bar`, YAML `key: value`, URLs) in forms 1/2 and the slash-body
> separator (one space) in forms 3/4; stacked prefixes (`A :: B :: rest`) apply
> outer-to-inner, left-to-right (expand `A`, re-scan, expand `B`, then the
> residual is the task); a leading `\` escapes the prefix for BOTH the `::` and
> the slash form (`\BACKGROUND :: x`, `\/BACKGROUND x` — treat literally, strip
> the backslash, NO expansion) so action names can be discussed. **Conflict rule
> (slash form):** `/ACTION_NAME` (form 3) is honored as the action ONLY when
> `ACTION_NAME` (case-folded) does not collide with a built-in/host slash command
> (registry `slash_bare: auto` + `slash_conflicts: [..]`); form 4
> (`/PREFIX::ACTION_NAME`) is ALWAYS unambiguous and always honored. An unknown
> token that matches the grammar shape (any of the 4 forms) but is NOT registered
> is NEVER silently expanded or silently dropped — ask which registered action
> was meant (§11.4.66 / §11.4.105) or treat it as a literal prompt, NEVER invent
> an expansion (§11.4.6); any prompt not satisfying the grammar is an ordinary
> prompt and the system is a no-op. The registered action **`BACKGROUND`** expands
> to: *"The following prompt that we will provide MUST BE executed in background
> in parallel with all main work streams using the subagents-driven development
> approach! All work done MUST PRODUCE rock solid evidence covered with hard
> physical proof(s) that all done is working as expected and as specified without
> any false results and without any bluff!"* (composes §11.4.20 / §11.4.70
> subagent-driven, §11.4.58 / §11.4.103 parallel streams, §11.4.89 background
> execution, §11.4.5 / §11.4.69 / §11.4.107 captured physical evidence, §11.4
> anti-bluff). The system is UNIVERSAL (every CLI agent reads this block via its
> context carrier per §11.4.35), extensible (new action = new registry row),
> decoupled + reusable (§11.4.28), and loads out-of-the-box. Classification:
> universal (§11.4.17). **Canonical authority:** constitution submodule
> [`Constitution.md`](Constitution.md) §11.4.140. Non-compliance is a release

## Token-efficiency mandate (§11.4.141)

**§11.4.141 — Token-efficiency mandate (research-derived + operator mandate, 2026-06-09).** Every project worked on by AI coding agents MUST cut token spend (input AND output) toward **30–40% of current (a 60–70% reduction)** WITHOUT degrading quality/performance/safety or breaking any existing mechanism, via a composable, safety-ranked measure set: (1) **prompt-cache the static governance prefix** — the always-loaded governance forms a byte-stable cache-breakpointed prefix with no volatile bytes ahead of it; cache reads cost ~0.1× base input (the dominant cost driver — measured ~170K tokens of governance re-sent every turn, externally corroborated by Claude Code issue #24147); caching is transparent so it removes no rule, weakens no gate, changes no verdict — only billing (PRIMARY, biggest + safest lever); the operative discipline is to **batch governance edits and keep CLAUDE.md + the constitution byte-stable mid-session** — every governance edit busts the prompt cache (BASELINE.md finding); (2) **subagent model-tiering + output-to-file** — mechanical non-judgment work (search/grep/status/doc-export/read-only probes) to a Haiku-class model, the strong model RESERVED for all reasoning/verdicts/fix-design (§11.4.102)/code-review (§11.4.125)/demotion (§11.4.7), large output persisted to a file not an inline 350–520K-token transcript; the cheap model never emits a PASS so §11.4.50 + anti-bluff are untouched; (3) **thin always-loaded INDEX + on-demand detail** — concise index (one line per fix/anchor, EACH carrying the literal `11.4.N` token so propagation gates pass) with the canonical full text kept gate-scanned in `constitution/Constitution.md` and reachable in one hop — a de-duplication realising §11.4.35, never a deletion; (4) **CodeGraph/retrieval-first over full-file loading** (§11.4.78/§11.4.79); (5) **output-token reduction** — terse status + `effort:"low"` on the mechanical allowlist only; (6) **tool-call batching + no re-reads**; (7) **compaction/context-editing for long sessions**. **Mandatory measured proof:** a token-accounting harness measures tokens-per-development-cycle BEFORE vs AFTER on a frozen deterministic workload from the authoritative `usage` object (input/cache_read/cache_creation/output split; NEVER `tiktoken`, NEVER the client-side cost estimate), reproduced N times (§11.4.50), pass = AFTER ≤ 40% of BEFORE OR the measured best-safe reduction with a cited cold-cache reason; the AFTER run MUST show ZERO regression on the pre-build sweep + meta-test mutation sweep + propagation gates + a strong-model reasoning probe + a cache-warm proof (`cache_read_input_tokens > 0`) — cost reduction with quality regression is a §11.4 FAIL. The headline number is the *measured* reduction, never the design estimate (§11.4.6/§11.4.123). No measure may break/degrade any existing mechanism, and the rule is structured so none can. Composes §11.4.5/.6/.20/.40/.50/.58/.69/.70/.78/.79/.80/.103/.106/.123/.125/.128/§12.6/§1.1. Classification: universal (§11.4.17). Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-141-PROPAGATION` (literal `11.4.141`) + recommended gate `CM-TOKEN-EFFICIENCY` + paired §1.1 mutation (inject a pre-breakpoint volatile token → cache collapses → measured reduction falls below bar → gate FAILs). **Canonical authority:** constitution submodule [`Constitution.md`](Constitution.md) §11.4.141. Non-compliance is a release blocker. No escape hatch — no `--skip-token-efficiency`, `--no-cache-governance`, `--assert-reduction-without-measuring`, `--tier-down-reasoning`, `--inline-all-governance`, `--tiktoken-estimate-OK` flag.

## When in doubt

- Read `constitution/Constitution.md` for the canonical text of every rule.
- Cross-reference the sibling carriers (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `QWEN.md`)
  — they carry the same universal content for their respective agents.
- If still unclear, ask the operator. Do NOT guess. Do NOT bluff (§11.4.6).
