name: Reporting Workable Items
description: 'Use whenever anything trackable is reported or discovered — a bug, a defect, a regression, a feature request, an internal task, a gap, "this is broken", "we should add X", "remember to do Y" — or when the operator invokes /issue, /bug, /task (or their /helix: and /default- forms, or the ISSUE/BUG/TASK action prefixes). Use it BEFORE answering a report in prose, and use it to check whether a report you are about to acknowledge has actually been turned into a real tracked item.'

# Reporting Workable Items (§11.4.202 · §11.4.148 · §11.4.171)

**A report that is only acknowledged is a lost requirement.** Answering "yes,
that's a bug, I'll look into it" in prose — without creating a tracked item — is
a §11.4.197 requirements-integrity violation: the requirement was accepted, then
silently evaporated. Every report becomes a **real, fully-populated, fully-synced
workable item**, or it is explicitly and honestly refused.

## The three report directives

| Directive | Use when | Resulting Type |
|---|---|---|
| `/helix:bug` (`/default-bug`) | A product **defect** — regression, user-visible broken behaviour | `Bug` |
| `/task` | An internal **workstream** — refactor, doc, infra, gate, audit | `Task` |
| `/issue` | **Anything trackable**, type not yet decided | classified into `{Bug｜Feature｜Task}` |

Note: the bare `/bug` collides with Claude Code's built-in — always use
`/helix:bug` or `/default-bug` (see the `action-prefix-system` skill).

## Classification is a closed set (§11.4.16)

`Bug` · `Feature` · `Task`. **There is no fourth type and no "Issue" type** —
`/issue` is an *entry point*, not a type. Inventing a type is a §11.4.16
violation.

- Classify from the report's own content, stated as **FACT** (§11.4.6 — never a
  guess).
- If the content does not determine the type, **ASK** (§11.4.66 / §11.4.105)
  before creating the item.
- Only when running autonomously where asking is impossible (§11.4.101), default
  to the lowest-stakes `Task`, record the literal
  `Classification: defaulted-to-Task (§11.4.16 ambiguity default — reclassify)`
  in the description, and surface the reclassification command to the operator.
  **Never silently assert a type the report does not support.**

## What a GOOD report contains

The item's description must be **comprehensive and human-readable** — a team
member who was not in the room must understand it without reading code
(§11.4.171). Structure it (§11.4.148 D2):

1. **WHAT** — subject + problem/goal in one self-contained sentence. Never a
   bare fragment like "Composes with" or "Critical" (§11.4.91 forbids those).
2. **SCOPE / MANIFEST** — the components, files, surfaces, or platforms touched.
3. **REPRODUCTION** — for a `Bug`: the exact sequence that reproduces it. If a
   working reproduction already exists, use **its exact sequence** — a deviating
   repro that never reaches the precondition proves nothing (§11.4.199).
4. **ACCEPTANCE** — the observable, machine-checkable condition that means done
   (the §11.4.108 runtime signature: what must be true on a clean deployment).
5. **EVIDENCE** — captured artefact paths that back the report (§11.4.5 /
   §11.4.69): log, recording, sink-probe, crash trace, screenshot.

A one-liner that names neither subject nor problem is refused by the summary
generators (§11.4.91) — write the heading as the operator would read it.

## What creating an item actually does

Reporting is not a note-to-self. The engine
(`constitution/scripts/reporting/report_item.sh`) drives the full chain:

1. **Create** in the workable-items SQLite **single source of truth** with a
   stable, auto-incremented ticket id (§11.4.93 / §11.4.95 / §11.4.54), Status
   `Queued`, the chosen Type, and the structured description above.
2. **Regenerate every derived document from the DB** — Issues / Fixed / the
   summaries and their HTML / PDF / DOCX siblings (§11.4.12 / §11.4.53 /
   §11.4.65 / §11.4.106). The docs are outputs; the DB is the source.
3. **Push to every configured external tracker** (§11.4.148 D5).

## Anti-bluff on every step (§11.4 / §11.4.6)

- A tracker whose credentials or client are **absent** is **SKIPPED with an
  honest reason** (§11.4.10 / §11.4.3). A push is **NEVER faked**, and its
  absence is **NEVER hidden**.
- Report back, always: the **assigned ticket id**, the **chosen type**, the
  **doc-sync verdict**, and **each tracker's verdict with its captured-evidence
  path** (§11.4.5 / §11.4.69).
- Claiming "created + synced" without those verdicts is a PASS-bluff at the
  reporting layer.

## After the item exists

- A `Bug` that is actionable now → investigate under **§11.4.102
  systematic-debugging** (root cause BEFORE any fix; the Iron Law is "NO FIXES
  WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST"), and auto-activate it without waiting
  to be asked (§11.4.102(D)).
- Lifecycle from here — statuses, closure vocabulary, reopens, the testing diary
  — is the `workable-item-lifecycle` skill.
