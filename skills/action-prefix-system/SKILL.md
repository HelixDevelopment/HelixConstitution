# Action Prefix System (§11.4.140)

A prompt whose **first non-blank line** starts with a registered action token is
not an ordinary prompt: the token is **replaced** by that action's registered
`expansion` text, the action's `rules` apply, and the remainder of the prompt is
the actual task, executed under the expanded instruction.

The registry — `constitution/actions/registry.yaml` (override with
`$HELIX_ACTION_REGISTRY`) — is the **single source of truth**. It is DATA:
adding an action is a registry row, never a code change.

## The six equivalent forms

All six resolve to the SAME action, the SAME expansion, the SAME execution:

| # | Form | Example |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `ACTION :: <rest>` | `BACKGROUND :: refactor the parser` |
| 2 | `PREFIX::ACTION :: <rest>` | `DEFAULT::BACKGROUND :: refactor the parser` |
| 3 | `/ACTION <rest>` | `/background refactor the parser` |
| 4 | `/PREFIX::ACTION <rest>` | `/DEFAULT::BACKGROUND refactor the parser` |
| 5 | `ACTION ---> <rest>` | `BACKGROUND ---> refactor the parser` |
| 6 | `ACTION: <rest>` — **single colon** | `BUG: subtitles render one frame late` |

`PREFIX` is a **namespace**; the reserved default namespace is `DEFAULT`. An
action runs with or without it.

**Form 6 is the one most people type naturally** (`BUG: ...`, `TASK: ...`) — a
colon and exactly one space, no space *before* the colon.

### Form 6 is REGISTERED-ACTION-ONLY by construction

Unlike the other five, an unknown single-colon token is a **silent no-op** — it
never asks for clarification and never resolves to a sub-system
(`single_colon_registered_only: true`). This is deliberate: ordinary prose like
`TODO: fix this later`, `NOTE: see below`, or `WARNING: slow path` MUST NOT
trigger a directive or a clarifying question. Only a token that is *already
registered* activates in form 6.

## Grammar (all of these hold)

- **Anchored to the first non-blank line only.** A token mid-prose NEVER matches.
- **UPPERCASE only** — `[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*`. Lowercase never matches. (File and
  directory names stay lowercase snake_case per §11.4.29 — the *token* is upper.)
- **Namespace separator `::` carries NO surrounding spaces** (`PREFIX::ACTION`),
  which is what distinguishes it from the **body separator** `" :: "` (exactly
  one ASCII space each side). That spacing rule is why C++ `Foo::Bar`, YAML
  `key: value`, and URLs never false-trigger.
- **Body separators:** `" :: "` (forms 1/2), `" ---> "` (form 5), one space
  (forms 3/4), and `": "` — colon + exactly one space, **no space before the
  colon** — (form 6).
- **Stacked prefixes** apply outer-to-inner, left-to-right: `A :: B :: rest`
  expands `A`, re-scans, expands `B`, and the residual is the task.
- **Escape with a leading `\`** — `\BACKGROUND :: x`, `\BACKGROUND ---> x`,
  `\/BACKGROUND x` are literal: strip the backslash, NO expansion. Use this to
  *discuss* an action without invoking it.

## The conflict rule — never silently shadow a host command

A bare `/ACTION` (form 3) is honored **only** when it does not collide with a
built-in/host slash command. Collisions are declared as data in the registry
(`slash_bare: auto` + `slash_conflicts: [...]`).

- **`/PREFIX::ACTION` (form 4) is ALWAYS unambiguous** and always honored.
- On **Claude Code**, plugin namespacing *is* the form-4 escape:
  **`/helix:<name>`** always resolves to the action.
  A third, collision-free form works on every agent: **`/default-<name>`**.
- Worked example: `BUG` declares `slash_conflicts: [bug]` because Claude Code
  ships a built-in `/bug`. So the bare `/bug` goes to the **host built-in**, and
  the action is invoked as **`/helix:bug`** or **`/default-bug`**. The plugin
  does not fight the host and does not hide it.

## The iron rule for unknown tokens (§11.4.6)

A token that matches the grammar shape but is **NOT registered** is **NEVER**
silently expanded. In forms 1–5, do exactly one of:

1. Ask which registered action was meant (§11.4.66 / §11.4.105), or
2. Treat the line literally as an ordinary prompt.

**Exception — form 6 only:** an unregistered single-colon token is a **silent
no-op** by design (see above). `TODO: ...` must never provoke a question.

**Never invent an expansion.** Inventing one is a §11.4.6 no-guessing violation.
A prompt that does not satisfy the grammar is an ordinary prompt — the system is
a silent no-op, which is the correct behaviour.

## Sub-system shortcuts

A grammar-shaped UPPERCASE token that is not a *behavioral* action MAY name an
incorporated sub-system/submodule (from the registry `subsystems:` catalogue, or
auto-derived by recursive `.gitmodules` discovery from the invoking project's
root). It expands to a **sub-system context injection** (repository + org +
checkout location + the §11.4.28 decoupling/equal-codebase rules + §11.4.37
fetch-first + §11.4.113 no-force-push), and the remainder is the task on that
sub-system. A behavioral **action always wins** a token collision. An **ambiguous**
token (resolving to >1 sub-system) is DROPPED → falls through to ASK.

## Adding a new action

1. Add one row under `actions:` in `constitution/actions/registry.yaml`
   (`name`, `summary`, `expansion`, `rules`, `slash_bare`, `slash_conflicts`).
2. Re-run `bash constitution/scripts/generate_agent_prefix_commands.sh`.
3. Every agent's slash command appears: Claude Code plugin command,
   Gemini/Qwen `.toml`, Codex prompt `.md`. **No code changes.**

The generator + installer are re-run automatically on every constitution pull
(§11.4.164 `post_update_hook.sh`), so a new directive is live out of the box.
