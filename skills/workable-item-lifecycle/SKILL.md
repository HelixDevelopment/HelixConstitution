name: Workable Item Lifecycle
description: Use when moving a tracked item through its lifecycle — starting work, marking it ready for testing, closing it, reopening it, marking it obsolete or operator-blocked — or when asked which Status/Type value is legal, how to close a Feature vs a Bug, why the Issues/Fixed docs must be regenerated rather than hand-edited, what a reopen must record, or what belongs in a per-item testing diary.
version: 1.0.0

# Workable Item Lifecycle

The workable-items **SQLite DB is the single source of truth** (§11.4.93,
tracked in git per §11.4.95). Issues / Fixed / the summaries and their HTML /
PDF / DOCX siblings are **generated outputs** (§11.4.12 / §11.4.53 / §11.4.65 /
§11.4.106). **Never hand-edit a generated doc** — change the DB and regenerate,
or the next regeneration silently reverts your edit.

## Status — closed set (§11.4.15 / §11.4.21 / §11.4.90)

`Queued` · `In progress` · `Ready for testing` · `In testing` · `Reopened` ·
`Operator-blocked` · terminal closure · `Obsolete (→ Fixed.md)`

## Type — closed set (§11.4.16)

`Bug` · `Feature` · `Task`. No fourth value. `Task` is the lowest-stakes default
when genuinely ambiguous.

## Closure vocabulary is TYPE-AWARE (§11.4.33)

| Type | Closure Status |
|---|---|
| `Bug` | `Fixed (→ Fixed.md)` |
| `Feature` | `Implemented (→ Fixed.md)` |
| `Task` | `Completed (→ Fixed.md)` |

Closing a `Feature` as "Fixed", or a `Task` as "Implemented", is a §11.4.33
violation. All three are semantically equivalent ("closed, positive evidence
captured") but the literal must match the Type.

## Closure requires captured evidence — always (§11.4.123 / §11.4.108)

An item may be closed **only** with rock-solid captured proof (§11.4.5 /
§11.4.69 / §11.4.107). **Forbidden as proof:** metadata-only, configuration-only,
absence-of-error, and grep-without-runtime.

"Done" means the item's **runtime signature verifies on a clean deployment**
(§11.4.108) — source-committed ≠ artifact-contains-it ≠ active-on-clean-target ≠
works-for-the-user. Green at the source layer says nothing about the other three.

If you are unsure **how** to validate something, that is a research trigger, not
a licence to accept a weak PASS: do the deep research first (§11.4.123).

## Reopening (§11.4.34 / §11.4.55)

A reopen is a **demotion from closed** and therefore requires positive evidence
captured under the conditions that re-exposed the defect (§11.4.7). Record:

- **By:** `AI` or `User`
- **On:** ISO date
- **Reason:** from the closed vocabulary — `test-failed` ·
  `manual-testing-detected` · `captured-evidence-contradicts` ·
  `end-user-report` · `cycle-re-discovered` · `design-reconsidered`
- **Evidence:** path to the captured artefact

Items with `reopens_count > 0` carry a per-item reopen history doc. A high
reopen count is the strongest empirical fragility signal — those cases get the
**deepest live-testing scrutiny, and they get it FIRST** (§11.4.189 / §11.4.132).

## Operator-blocked is a LAST resort (§11.4.21)

Only after documenting exhaustion of every self-resolution path (available
CLI/API access, subagent delegation, existing tooling, a captured fallback,
external research). It must state **WHAT / WHY (each exhausted alternative) /
UNBLOCK CONDITION / WHO**. A fake `Operator-blocked` is a covenant violation at
the planning layer.

## Obsolete needs a reason + a triple check (§11.4.90)

Reasons: `superseded-by-design-change` · `superseded-by-later-mandate` ·
`feature-removed` · `duplicate-of` · `unsupported-topology` ·
`not-reproducible`. Removing an existing end-user capability additionally
requires **asking the operator first** (§11.4.122) — never a silent removal.

## Nothing may sit un-wired forever (§11.4.197)

Every started effort — research, spike, design doc, half-landed feature — reaches
a **terminal state**: fully COMPLETED *and wired* (integrated and used by
default, not parked behind a dead flag) **or** explicitly, evidence-backed
CLOSED. There is no third "sitting in the backlog un-wired" state.

## Per-item testing diary (§11.4.149)

Append-only, one entry per test event: date/time · tested-by · result ·
observations · action taken + why. **A PASS entry without an evidence path is
rejected by the schema** — that constraint is the anti-bluff mechanism, not
paperwork.

## Practical rules

- Update Status as work actually progresses — a stale Status is a lie the whole
  pipeline reads.
- Every status change flows **DB → regenerate docs**, in the same commit.
- Fix ⇒ a permanent regression guard (§11.4.135), authored RED on the broken
  artifact and flipped GREEN on the fixed one (§11.4.115).
