# Translations — Mandatory HelixTranslate Standard (§11.4.133)

This document summarizes the inherited translation mandate, the canonical pipeline,
and the validation workflow in human-readable form. The authoritative source is
**Constitution.md §11.4.133**; this is a digest, not a substitute.

## The mandate (in one sentence)

Every project that inherits this constitution MUST generate **ANY** translation it
needs through **HelixTranslate** (`git@github.com:HelixDevelopment/HelixTranslate.git`)
via the canonical universal pipeline in `scripts/translation/`. Hard rule — no
exceptions.

## What it covers

ALL content rendered in a non-source language: UI strings, documents, articles, CVs,
READMEs, marketing copy, in-app messages, release notes, legal text — any
human-language string. There is no category of content exempt from this mandate.

## The four hard rules

1. **No hand-translation.** No human-authored or manually edited translation, ever.
   The engine is the single source of every translated string.
2. **No other engines.** No Google Translate, DeepL, raw ChatGPT/Claude prompting, OS
   translation APIs, or library i18n auto-translators. Exactly one engine.
3. **No silent fallback.** No quiet source-string substitution, no empty/partial output
   passed off as a translation, no swallowed error. On exhaustion of all providers the
   pipeline FAILS LOUD — non-zero exit, destination not written. (Provider failover
   *within* HelixTranslate, primary → fallback with logged retries, is allowed.)
4. **Mandatory validation.** Every translation is validated for accuracy with real,
   captured evidence. Unvalidated/unevidenced translation = ABSENT.

## The canonical pipeline

Location: `scripts/translation/`

- `translate-pipeline.sh` — universal Markdown / plain-text translator.
  - **plain** mode: translates the whole file.
  - **`--article`** mode: keeps YAML frontmatter byte-identical (slugs, repos, tech,
    title, teaser are proper nouns / URLs / language-neutral and must survive so links
    and rendering keep working); translates ONLY the body, then reassembles.
- `render-articles.sh` — renders translated article sources to standalone HTML
  fragments for embedding (e.g. "Read more" modals).

```bash
# Translate:
translate-pipeline.sh --in src.md --out dst.ru.md --lang ru            # plain
translate-pipeline.sh --in src.md --out dst.sr.md --lang sr --article  # article

# Render to HTML fragments:
render-articles.sh <site-root> ru sr
```

Language → script: `ru` → cyrillic, `sr` → latin.

## Provider routing (explicit, recorded)

| Role | Provider | Model |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary | `groq` | `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` |
| Fallback | `mistral` | `mistral-large-latest` |

Failover: retry the primary up to 3× with linear backoff, then fail over to the
fallback. The provider that actually produced each output is recorded in the per-file
log. Routing is never implicit — any deviation must be stated in configuration and
logged.

Engine binary: supplied by the consuming project via `HELIX_TRANSLATE_BIN`, built from
the HelixTranslate repository.

## Validation workflow

1. **Run** the pipeline for each source → target pair. It calls the HelixTranslate
   engine with explicit `provider` / `model` / `source-lang` / `target-lang` / `script`.
2. **Evidence is captured automatically** to a per-file log under
   `$TRANSLATE_EVIDENCE_DIR` (default `<project>/_tests/evidence/translate/`): the
   provider used, byte counts, each retry, and success/failure are appended per run.
3. **Fail-loud check.** If all providers are exhausted, the script exits non-zero and
   does NOT write the destination — callers MUST treat this as a hard error, never ship
   the source string in its place.
4. **Accuracy validation.** Validate each produced translation for accuracy with real
   (physical) evidence (per §11.4.5 / §11.4.69 / §11.4.107). The run log is the evidence
   artifact. An unvalidated or unevidenced output is treated as ABSENT.
5. **Re-runnable / idempotent.** Each invocation recomputes the output from source and
   overwrites the destination, so re-validation always reflects current source.

## Inheritance

This is the inherited standard. Consuming projects restate + cite §11.4.133 via
§11.4.35 inheritance. Non-compliance is a release blocker; there is no escape hatch.
