## 1. What the system is

A prompt whose **first non-blank line** starts with a registered UPPERCASE action
token is not an ordinary prompt. The token is **replaced** by that action's
registered `expansion` text, the action's `rules` apply, and the remainder of the
prompt is the actual task, executed under the expanded instruction.

`actions/registry.yaml` is the **single source of truth**, and it is **DATA**:
adding a directive is a registry row — never a code change in any consumer.

The system has two independent layers. Both read the same registry.

| Layer | Mechanism | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **LAYER 1 — recognition** | The agent reads the §11.4.140 block in its context carrier (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `QWEN.md` / `GEMINI.md`) and expands the prefix itself. Works in any agent, including ones with no hook or command support. | `actions/recognition_instruction.md` (the canonical carrier block) |
| **LAYER 2 — mechanical** | (a) A Claude Code `UserPromptSubmit` hook rewrites/augments the prompt deterministically before the model sees it. (b) Generated **slash commands** per agent. Both survive a model recall lapse (the §11.4.109 anti-forgetting pattern). | `scripts/hooks/action_prefix_expand.sh`, `plugins/helix/commands/`, `actions/generated/<agent>/` |

**Honest boundary (§11.4.6).** LAYER 2's prompt-expansion hook exists only for
Claude Code. Gemini CLI / Qwen Code / Codex CLI get LAYER 1 (the carrier block)
plus generated slash commands — they have **no** pre-submit hook, so a free-form
`BUG: …` prompt on those agents is expanded by the model reading its carrier
block, not by a hook.

## 2. File layout

| Path | Kind | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `actions/registry.yaml` | **DATA — source of truth** | Grammar constants, the registered `actions:`, the `subsystems:` catalogue. |

| `actions/generated/gemini/<name>.toml` | **generated** | Gemini CLI custom command. |
| `actions/generated/qwen/<name>.toml` | **generated** | Qwen Code custom command. |
| `actions/generated/codex/<name>.md` | **generated** | OpenAI Codex CLI prompt file. |
| `actions/generated/README.md` | **generated** | Per-agent install-target table + count. |

| `scripts/generate_agent_prefix_commands.sh` | generator | Registry → all agents' command files + both READMEs. |
| `scripts/install_cli_agent_plugins.sh` | installer | Regenerate + link skills + register marketplace + install plugin. |
| `scripts/install_action_prefix.sh` | installer | Registers the `UserPromptSubmit` hook in `.claude/settings.json`. |
| `scripts/hooks/action_prefix_expand.sh` | hook | The `UserPromptSubmit` prompt-expansion hook (Claude Code). |

**Generated files must never be hand-edited.** Each carries a `DO NOT EDIT`
banner naming its source row. Edit `actions/registry.yaml`, re-run the generator.

## 3. Registry schema

### 3.1 Top level

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `schema_version` | int | Currently `1`. Required — the library's `validate` refuses a registry without it. |
| `grammar` | map | The grammar constants (§3.2). Required — `grammar.prefix_regex` must be present for validation to pass. |
| `actions` | list | The registered behavioural actions (§3.3). Must be non-empty; every entry needs `name` + `expansion`. |
| `subsystems` | list | The curated sub-system catalogue (§3.4). Optional. |

### 3.2 `grammar:` fields

| Field | Value in the shipped registry | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `prefix_regex` | `^([A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*) :: ` | Legacy bare-`::` anchor (form 1). Kept for back-compat; its **presence is what `apx_validate_registry` checks**. |
| `colon_form_regex` | `^(?:([A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*)::)?([A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*) :: (.*)$` | Forms 1 + 2. g1 = optional `PREFIX`, g2 = `ACTION`, g3 = rest. |
| `single_colon_form_regex` | `^(?:([A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*)::)?([A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*): (.*)$` | Form 6 (§11.4.202). |
| `single_colon_registered_only` | `true` | An unknown single-colon token is a **NO-OP**, never an ASK, never a sub-system. |
| `single_colon_body_separator` | `": "` | Colon + exactly one space; **no space before the colon**. |
| `slash_form_regex` | `^/(?:([A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*)::)?([A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*)\s+(.*)$` | Forms 3 + 4. |
| `arrow_form_regex` | `^(?:([A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*)::)?([A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*) ---> (.*)$` | Form 5. |
| `arrow_body_separator` | `" ---> "` | One ASCII space each side of `--->`. |
| `body_separator` | `" :: "` | One ASCII space each side of `::` (forms 1/2). |
| `slash_body_separator` | `" "` | One space (forms 3/4). |
| `namespace_separator` | `"::"` | **Inside** the token — `PREFIX::ACTION`, **no surrounding spaces**. |
| `default_namespace` | `DEFAULT` | The reserved namespace an un-prefixed action resolves under. |
| `slash_prefix` | `"/"` | The slash-form leader. |
| `case_sensitive` | `true` | Action names are UPPERCASE-only. |
| `multiple_prefixes` | `stack` | `A :: B :: rest` applies A then B (outer-to-inner). |
| `escape` | `\` | A leading backslash makes the prefix literal. |

### 3.3 `actions[]` fields

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | **yes** | UPPERCASE token, `[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*`. The lowercased name becomes the slash-command filename. |
| `expansion` | **yes** | The text that REPLACES the prefix. Folded scalar (`>-`); newlines collapse to single spaces. |
| `version` | no | Registry-row version (informational). |
| `namespaces` | no | Which namespaces the action is registered under (shipped rows: `[DEFAULT]`). |
| `slash_bare` | no | `auto` = the bare `/name` form is honored **unless** a host built-in collides. |
| `slash_conflicts` | no | List of known colliding host slash commands. Non-empty ⇒ the generator emits a `CONFLICT` comment in the command file and a warning row in the plugin README. `BUG` declares `[bug]`. |
| `summary` | no | One-line description. Becomes the command's `description:` frontmatter and the README cell. Falls back to a generic string if absent. |
| `rules` | no | Behavioural rules the agent applies alongside the expansion. **Read by LAYER 1 (the agent) — the generator does not embed them in the command files.** |
| `composes_with` | no | Constitution anchors this action composes with (documentation). |

### 3.4 `subsystems[]` fields

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | **yes** | Display name; the uppercased form is the canonical token (`HelixOTA` → `HELIXOTA`). |
| `url` | **yes** | Canonicalised to merge with any local checkout of the same repo. |
| `org` | no | Owning org (defaults to the org parsed from the URL). |
| `aliases` | no | Extra UPPERCASE tokens (abbreviations, snake forms) — e.g. `HXOTA`. |

### 3.5 Registered actions (shipped)

| Action | Type produced | `slash_conflicts` | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| `BACKGROUND` | — | — | Run the rest of the prompt as a durable, subagent-driven background work stream, in parallel with the main stream, with hard physical proof. |
| `REMINDER` | — | — | Re-surface previously-scheduled, critical, status-UNCERTAIN work: verify the ACTUAL status from captured evidence FIRST, then act on the delta. |
| `BUG` | `Bug` | `[bug]` | Report a product defect → fully-populated Type=Bug workable item + full DB → docs → tracker sync. |
| `TASK` | `Task` | — | Report an internal workstream item → Type=Task workable item + full sync. |
| `ISSUE` | `{Bug｜Feature｜Task}` | — | Report anything trackable; classify into the §11.4.16 closed set, then create + sync. |

---

## 4. The grammar (§11.4.140 + §11.4.202)

### 4.1 Six equivalent forms

All six resolve to the **same action, the same expansion, the same execution**.

| # | Form | Example | Anchor regex |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `ACTION :: <rest>` | `BACKGROUND :: refactor the parser` | `^([A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*) :: (.*)$` |
| 2 | `PREFIX::ACTION :: <rest>` | `DEFAULT::BACKGROUND :: refactor the parser` | `^([A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*)::([A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*) :: (.*)$` |
| 3 | `/ACTION <rest>` | `/task bump the pandoc pin` | `^/([A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*)\s+(.*)$` |
| 4 | `/PREFIX::ACTION <rest>` | `/DEFAULT::BUG audio is silent on HDMI` | `^/([A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*)::([A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*)\s+(.*)$` |
| 5 | `ACTION ---> <rest>` | `REMINDER ---> the OTA signing key rotation` | `^([A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*) ---> (.*)$` |
| 6 | `ACTION: <rest>` | `ISSUE: subtitles render one frame late` | `^([A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*): (.*)$` |

Thus `BUG :: x` ≡ `DEFAULT::BUG :: x` ≡ `/DEFAULT::BUG x` ≡ `BUG ---> x` ≡
`BUG: x` (and `/bug x` — **except** that `bug` is a declared collision; see §5).

**Form 6 was added by §11.4.202** and is the shape operators actually type. It is
**REGISTERED-ACTION-ONLY by construction** (see §4.6).

### 4.2 Anchoring

Every form is anchored to the **first non-blank line** of the prompt. A
grammar-shaped token in the middle of a paragraph never matches. Leading blank
lines are skipped; every line after the first non-blank line is carried through
as part of the task (the "residual").

### 4.3 UPPERCASE only

The action token **and** the namespace are `[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*`. `background :: x`
never matches. This is `grammar.case_sensitive: true`, and it is what keeps the
system quiet in ordinary prose.

File and directory names stay lowercase snake_case (§11.4.29) — only the
*tokens* are uppercase.

### 4.4 Separator spacing — and why it is exactly this

The spacing rules are not cosmetic; each one exists to avoid a specific
false-trigger:

| Separator | Rule | The false-trigger it avoids |
|---|---|---|
| Namespace `::` **inside** the token | **No** surrounding spaces — `DEFAULT::BUG` | Keeps the namespace separator distinguishable from the body separator. |
| Body ` :: ` (forms 1/2) | Exactly one ASCII space **each side** | C++ / Rust / PHP scoping — `Foo::Bar`, `std::vector`, `Self::new` — has no spaces, so it never matches. |
| Body `: ` (form 6) | Colon + one space, **no space before** the colon | Distinguishes it from ` :: `. Still collides in *shape* with YAML `key: value` and prose `NOTE:` — which is exactly why form 6 is registered-action-only (§4.6). |
| Body ` ---> ` (form 5) | One ASCII space each side | An arrow inside prose (`a-->b`, `->`) does not match; only the exact ` ---> ` sequence after a valid leading token does. |
| Slash body (forms 3/4) | `/TOKEN` + one-or-more spaces | The leading `/` makes it unambiguous; a URL (`https://x/Y z`) never starts the line with `/UPPERCASE `. |

A URL such as `https://example.com/API` cannot match: form 3 requires the line to
**start** with `/`, and forms 1/2/5 require their spaced separators.

### 4.5 Escape

A single leading backslash on the first non-blank line makes the prefix literal:

```
\BACKGROUND :: this is discussed, not executed
\BACKGROUND ---> ditto
\/BACKGROUND ditto
\BUG: ditto
```

The backslash is stripped and **no expansion happens**. This is how action names
can be talked about (as this document does) without triggering them.

### 4.6 Unknown grammar-shaped tokens

| Form | Unknown token behaviour | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 | **ASK** (§11.4.66 / §11.4.105) — "this looks like an action prefix but is not registered; which registered action did you mean?" The closest registered name (longest shared prefix) is offered as a hint. **Never invent an expansion** (§11.4.6). | These shapes do not occur in ordinary prose, so an unknown one is almost certainly a typo or an unregistered directive. |
| 6 (`NAME: text`) | **NO-OP** — the prompt is ordinary text, passed through unchanged. Never an ASK, never a sub-system lookup. | `NOTE:` / `TODO:` / `WARNING:` / `FIXME:` are ordinary English openers with this exact shape. Routing them to the clarify path would question every such sentence. |

In no case is an unknown token silently expanded or silently dropped.

### 4.7 Stacking

`A :: B :: rest` applies outer-to-inner, left-to-right: expand `A`, re-scan the
residual, expand `B`, and the remaining text is the task. The expander recurses
on the residual and nests `outer-expansion` + blank line + `inner-emitted`.

---

## 5. The conflict rule (bare `/name` collisions)

**A bare `/<name>` is honored ONLY when it does not collide with a host built-in
slash command.** Collisions are declared as **data** in the registry, never
guessed:

```yaml
- name: BUG
  slash_bare: auto          # bare /bug honored *unless* a host command collides
  slash_conflicts: [bug]    # Claude Code ships a built-in /bug
```

What follows from that single data row:

| Invocation | What happens |
|---|---|
| `/bug …` | **The HOST built-in wins.** Claude Code resolves the bare name to its own `/bug` (report a bug to Anthropic). The plugin does **not** shadow it. |
| `/helix:bug …` | **The action.** Claude Code's plugin namespacing (`/<plugin>:<command>`) *is* the §11.4.140 form-4 `PREFIX::ACTION` escape — always unambiguous. |
| `/default-bug …` | **The action.** A collision-free alias generated for *every* agent (see §6). |
| `BUG: …` / `BUG :: …` / `BUG ---> …` | **The action.** No host command can affect these forms. |

The generator materialises the rule mechanically:

- the colliding command file (`plugins/helix/commands/bug.md`) carries an explicit
  `CONFLICT` comment naming the host command and the two safe invocations;
- the plugin README row for a colliding action reads
  ``| `/helix:bug` | `/bug` **COLLIDES** with host `bug` → use `/helix:bug` or `/default-bug` | … |``.

**The plugin never silently shadows a host command.** Non-colliding actions
(`BACKGROUND`, `REMINDER`, `TASK`, `ISSUE`) get the plain row
``| `/task` | `/helix:task` · `/default-task` | … |``.

---

## 6. Per-agent command mapping

Two command files are generated **per action**: the bare form and a
`default-<name>` alias.

| Agent | Generated at | Install location (consuming project) | Bare form (3) | Namespaced form (4) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `plugins/helix/commands/<name>.md` and `default-<name>.md` | installed as the plugin `helix` | `/<name>` | `/helix:<name>` (native plugin namespacing) **and** `/default-<name>` |
| **Gemini CLI** | `actions/generated/gemini/<name>.toml`, `default-<name>.toml` | symlinked into `.gemini/commands/` | `/<name>` | `/default-<name>` |
| **Qwen Code** | `actions/generated/qwen/<name>.toml`, `default-<name>.toml` | symlinked into `.qwen/commands/` | `/<name>` | `/default-<name>` |
| **Codex CLI** | `actions/generated/codex/<name>.md`, `default-<name>.md` | symlinked into `prompts/` | `/<name>` | `/default-<name>` |

All four are wired **automatically** by `install_cli_agent_plugins.sh` (see
[ADMIN_MANUAL](ADMIN_MANUAL.md)) — the plugin for Claude Code, one symlink per
command file for the other three (never a copy; never clobbering a hand-written
file).

**Per-agent capability differences — stated honestly (§11.4.6):**

- Only **Claude Code** can express a `::` inside a command name — and it does so
  through plugin namespacing (`/helix:bug`), not literally. Gemini / Qwen / Codex
  **cannot** express `::` in a command name at all: a command's name *is* its
  filename/token. `default-<name>` is their form-4 equivalent, and it maps to the
  identical expansion, so `/<name>` ≡ `/default-<name>` on every agent.
- Only **Claude Code** has a pre-submit prompt hook. On the other three agents the
  free-form forms (1, 2, 5, 6) are handled by LAYER 1 — the model reading its
  carrier block — not by a hook.
- Argument forwarding differs per agent and is handled by the generator:
  Claude Code and Codex use `$ARGUMENTS`; Gemini and Qwen use `{{args}}`.
- The generator writes Claude Code's commands **straight into the plugin tree**
  (single source of truth, no copy). The other three agents' files land under
  `actions/generated/<agent>/` and the installer symlinks them into each agent's
  project-level command directory.

---

## 7. Sub-system shortcuts (§11.4.140 extension)

A grammar-shaped UPPERCASE token that is **not** a registered action may name an
incorporated **sub-system / submodule**. It expands to a *sub-system context
injection* (repository + org + where-checked-out + §11.4.28 equal-codebase /
decoupling / dependency-layout + §11.4.37 fetch-first + §11.4.113 no-force-push +
§11.4.183 full-constitution + anti-bluff), and the rest of the prompt is the task
on that sub-system.

```
HXQA :: add a Challenge bank entry for the subtitle oracle
```

Two data sources feed one resolver (`apx_lookup_subsystem`):

| Source | What it provides |
|---|---|
| (a) the registry `subsystems:` catalogue | Curated Helix-ecosystem sub-systems + human abbreviations (`HXOTA` → HelixOTA, `HXQA` → HelixQA, `CTOOLKIT` → ClaudeToolkit, …). These are Helix-org products, so they carry no project coupling — a consuming project's own submodules are **never** listed here. |
| (b) recursive `.gitmodules` discovery | Walks the **invoking project's** submodule graph (depth ≤ 6) from `$HELIX_PROJECT_ROOT`, else the nearest ancestor of `$PWD` containing a `.gitmodules`. Every submodule auto-derives alias tokens: uppercased name, camelCase-split snake form, and initials. A newly-added submodule is covered out of the box with **no** edit to the registry. |

Resolution rules (all are §11.4.6 no-guessing safeguards):

- **A registered ACTION always wins** a token collision — the sub-system resolver
  drops any token that is a registered action name.
- Duplicate checkouts of the same submodule (same canonical URL) **collapse to
  one** sub-system.
- A token that maps to **more than one** sub-system is **DROPPED** → it falls
  through to the ASK path. It is never silently mis-expanded.
- Matching is UPPERCASE-exact.

**Honest boundary (§11.4.6):** sub-system resolution requires `python3` **and**
`PyYAML`. Without them it returns no match and the token falls to ASK exactly as
before. Behavioural actions are unaffected — they have an awk fallback.

---

## 8. The engine — `scripts/action_prefix_lib.sh`

The pure, agent-agnostic library reused by the hook, the generator, and the
tests. It writes no files and mutates no global state.

### 8.1 Public API

| Function | Returns |
|---|---|
| `apx_registry_path` | The resolved registry path (`$HELIX_ACTION_REGISTRY`, else `<lib>/../actions/registry.yaml`). |
| `apx_validate_registry` | Exit 0 if the registry parses **and** has `schema_version` + `grammar.prefix_regex` + ≥1 action with `name` + `expansion`. |
| `apx_list_actions` | One action name per line. |
| `apx_lookup_expansion <NAME>` | The action's expansion text; exit 1 if not registered. |
| `apx_lookup_subsystem <TOKEN>` | A sub-system context expansion for a unique, non-action, uppercase-exact token; exit 1 otherwise. |
| `apx_parse_prefix <PROMPT>` | TAB-separated `namespace<TAB>action<TAB>rest<TAB>form`. Presence of a grammar-shaped token — **not** registry membership. |
| `apx_expand_prompt <PROMPT>` | The single expander. Emits a JSON object (§8.2). |

### 8.2 `apx_expand_prompt` result JSON

| Field | Values |
|---|---|
| `matched` | `true` when a REGISTERED action or sub-system expanded. |
| `verdict` | `expand` · `noop` · `escape` · `ask` |
| `action` | The matched action name (or, on `ask`, the unknown token). |
| `namespace` | The resolved namespace — `DEFAULT` when the form carried none. |
| `form` | `colon` · `slash` · `arrow` · `single_colon` |
| `expansion` | The registered expansion text. |
| `residual` | The first-line remainder plus every following line. |
| `emitted` | The prompt the agent should act on: `expand` → `<expansion>\n\n<residual>`; `escape` → the prompt with the leading backslash stripped; `noop`/`ask` → the original prompt unchanged. |
| `closest` | On `ask`: the closest registered action name (longest shared leading prefix; may be empty). |
| `kind` | `action` · `subsystem` — appended last, so the first nine fields are byte-stable for existing readers. |

### 8.3 Resolution order (first match wins)

1. **Registered behavioural ACTION** (`apx_lookup_expansion`) → `expand`, `kind=action`.
2. **Form 6 fall-through** — if the form was `single_colon` and the token was not
   a registered action → `noop` (§4.6). Resolution stops here; a sub-system is
   never resolved from a single-colon token.
3. **Sub-system shortcut** (`apx_lookup_subsystem`) → `expand`, `kind=subsystem`.
4. **ASK** — grammar-shaped but unknown → `ask` + `closest`.

### 8.4 Dependencies and the fallback

The library prefers `python3` (+ `PyYAML`) for YAML parsing and for the anchored
capture-group parse. When python is absent it falls back to an **awk** reader
that targets exactly this registry's shape (folded `expansion:` scalars + simple
`name:` keys) — honestly narrower than a general YAML parser. Both paths
implement byte-identical anchored regexes and emit the identical 4-tuple, so they
cannot drift (§11.4.50 determinism). The sub-system tier has **no** awk fallback
(§7).

---

## 9. Scripts

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `scripts/generate_agent_prefix_commands.sh` | Reads the registry; for every action emits `plugins/helix/commands/<name>.md` + `default-<name>.md`, `actions/generated/{gemini,qwen}/<name>.toml` + `default-<name>.toml`, `actions/generated/codex/<name>.md` + `default-<name>.md`; regenerates `plugins/helix/README.md` (command inventory + conflict rows) and `actions/generated/README.md`. Aborts if `apx_validate_registry` fails. Deterministic; safe to re-run. Companion doc: [`docs/scripts/generate_agent_prefix_commands.md`](../scripts/generate_agent_prefix_commands.md). |
| `scripts/install_cli_agent_plugins.sh` | The single entry point. (1) runs the generator; (2) symlinks the Gemini / Qwen / Codex commands into `.gemini/commands/`, `.qwen/commands/`, `prompts/` — never clobbering a hand-written file; (3) chains `install_action_prefix.sh` to wire the `UserPromptSubmit` hook; (4) symlinks every constitution skill **that has a `SKILL.md`** into `<project>/.claude/skills/<name>`; (5) `claude plugin marketplace add <const_root>` + `claude plugin install helix@helix-constitution`, then **verifies via `claude plugin list`** — it never trusts the tool's own success message (§11.4.6 / §11.4.200). Flags: `--check` (constitution **and** project side), `--skills-only`, `--skill NAME`, `--no-plugin`. Companion doc: [`docs/scripts/install_cli_agent_plugins.md`](../scripts/install_cli_agent_plugins.md). |
| `scripts/install_action_prefix.sh` | The **owner** of the `UserPromptSubmit` hook entry in `<project>/.claude/settings.json` (BY REFERENCE — the entry points at the constitution path; the hook is never copied), backs the file up first, and regenerates the commands. Genuinely idempotent (refuses to append a hook command it already finds), which is why chaining it from the installer above is safe. |
| `scripts/hooks/action_prefix_expand.sh` | The Claude Code `UserPromptSubmit` hook. Reads the event JSON on stdin, expands via the library, and returns `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`. On no-match/escape it emits empty stdout (pass-through). On an unknown grammar-shaped token it injects a clarify note. On **any** internal error it FAILS OPEN (pass-through) — it never rejects or crashes a prompt. |
| `scripts/post_update_hook.sh` | §11.4.164 auto-propagation. On a constitution pull it diffs `ORIG_HEAD..HEAD` (falling back to `HEAD~1`), classifies changed files, and — when anything under `actions/**`, `plugins/**`, `.claude-plugin/**`, or `skills/**` changed — runs `install_cli_agent_plugins.sh` (STEP 4b). Also installs skills, merges MCP configs, installs git hooks, and `bash -n`-validates every touched script. |
| `scripts/reporting/report_item.sh` | The §11.4.202 engine the `BUG` / `TASK` / `ISSUE` expansions call: create the item in the workable-items SQLite SSoT → regenerate every derived document → push to every configured external tracker (absent credentials ⇒ honest SKIP-with-reason, never a faked push). Carries zero project literals; every project-specific value comes from a consumer-owned config. |

### 9.1 The plugin ships **no** hook — deliberately

`plugins/helix/` contains **only** `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `commands/*.md`
and a generated `README.md`. It deliberately does **not** ship a
`UserPromptSubmit` hook, because that would **double-expand** a prompt already
expanded by `scripts/hooks/action_prefix_expand.sh`. The plugin owns the
**commands**; `install_action_prefix.sh` owns the **prompt-expansion hook**.

The single install command chains both, so the operator runs one thing — but the
**ownership** split is load-bearing and must be preserved: exactly one component
may register that hook. (Verified invariant: after three consecutive installs,
`grep -c action_prefix_expand .claude/settings.json` → `1`.)

## 10. Skills

Three canonical Agent Skills (each a directory with a `SKILL.md` + a
`register.sh`), wired into a project by **symlink** into
`<project>/.claude/skills/<name>` — BY REFERENCE, never copied (§11.4.28 /
§11.4.80: a copy diverges silently).

| Skill | Loads when |
|---|---|
| `action-prefix-system` | A prompt begins with an UPPERCASE action token in any form; or the operator asks how the directive system works, how to add one, why a bare `/name` did not resolve, or what an unregistered grammar-shaped token should do. **Also before inventing any expansion for an unknown token.** |
| `reporting-workable-items` | Anything trackable is reported or discovered — a bug, a regression, a feature request, an internal task, "this is broken", "we should add X" — or `/issue` / `/bug` / `/task` is invoked. Use it **before** answering a report in prose. |
| `workable-item-lifecycle` | Moving a tracked item through its lifecycle — start, ready-for-testing, close, reopen, obsolete, operator-blocked — or asking which Status/Type is legal, how to close a Feature vs a Bug, or why generated docs must never be hand-edited. |

**Honest boundary (§11.4.6).** `constitution/skills/` also contains four **legacy**
directories — `media-validator`, `scheduled-work-queue`, `session-sync` (lowercase
`skill.md`) and `multitrack` (only a `register.sh`). They lack a `SKILL.md`, so
they are **not discoverable as Agent Skills** and the installer deliberately
**skips** them, reporting the count. They are not part of this system.

## 11. Gates and tests

| Artifact | Asserts |
|---|---|
| `scripts/gates/cm_subsystem_shortcuts.sh` (+ `_mutation_test.sh`) | The sub-system shortcut mechanism is present and wired. |
| `scripts/gates/cm_covenant_114_202_propagation.sh` (+ `_mutation_test.sh`) | The `11.4.202` anchor literal is present in every owned context carrier (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `QWEN.md` / `GEMINI.md`) across the consumer fleet. Exits non-zero on any carrier missing it. `Constitution.md` is intentionally not re-scanned (it is the anchor's own source of truth). |
| `tests/action_prefix/test_action_prefix_grammar.sh` | The grammar — every form, escape, stacking, anchoring, unknown-token verdicts. |
| `tests/action_prefix/meta_test_action_prefix_grammar.sh` | The paired §1.1 mutation — a broken grammar must make the grammar test FAIL. |
| `tests/action_prefix/test_hook_e2e.sh` | The `UserPromptSubmit` hook end-to-end. |
| `tests/action_prefix/test_subsystem_shortcuts.sh` | Sub-system alias derivation, ambiguity-drop, action-wins. |

## 12. Honest boundaries (§11.4.6)

Documented because they are true today, not because they are desirable:

1. **Six forms, not five.** §11.4.140's own anchor text and
   `actions/recognition_instruction.md` (rev 3) still describe **five** forms.
   §11.4.202 added the sixth (single-colon `NAME: <text>`), and the sixth **is**
   implemented in `actions/registry.yaml` (`single_colon_form_regex`) and in both
   parse paths of `scripts/action_prefix_lib.sh`. The carrier block is therefore
   **behind** the implementation. This reference documents the implementation.
2. **No prompt hook outside Claude Code.** The deterministic `UserPromptSubmit`
   expansion exists only for Claude Code. On Gemini / Qwen / Codex the free-form
   forms (1/2/5/6) rely on LAYER 1 — the model reading its context carrier. Only
   the **slash commands** are mechanically wired there.
3. **Sub-system shortcuts need `python3` + `PyYAML`.** Without them the token falls
   to ASK. Behavioural actions are unaffected (awk fallback).
4. **The marketplace lists two plugins.** `helix` (this system) and
   `scheduled-work` (a separate MCP-backed plugin that requires building a Go
   binary via `plugins/scheduled-work/build.sh`). The installer installs **only**
   `helix`.
5. **`--check` cannot resolve the plugin state without the `claude` CLI.** In that
   case it reports **UNKNOWN** — never "installed", never "missing" (§11.4.201: a
   guard must assert the real condition or say honestly that it could not).
