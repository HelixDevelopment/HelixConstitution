# Action Directives — Administrator Manual

**Revision:** 2
**Last modified:** 2026-07-14T22:05:00Z
**Authority:** constitution §11.4.140 (action-prefix system) + §11.4.202 (reporting directives) + §11.4.164 (post-update auto-propagation) + §11.4.75 (mechanical enforcement)
**Maintainer:** constitution submodule (inherited BY REFERENCE per §11.4.28(B) / §11.4.177)
**Scope:** for whoever wires the directive system into a consuming project — install, verify, auto-load, extend, troubleshoot, uninstall.

## 1. Install

From the **consuming project's root**, with the constitution submodule present —
**one command wires everything**:

```bash
bash constitution/scripts/install_cli_agent_plugins.sh
```

Idempotent. Re-running is always safe. Real output:

```
[install-plugins] regenerated slash commands from registry (10 Claude Code command file(s))
[install-plugins] wired 10 gemini command(s) → .gemini/commands/
[install-plugins] wired 10 qwen command(s) → .qwen/commands/
[install-plugins] wired 10 codex command(s) → prompts/
[install-plugins] wired the UserPromptSubmit prefix hook (free-form 'NAME :: task' forms)
[install-plugins] linked 3 skill(s) into .claude/skills/ (4 legacy dir(s) without SKILL.md skipped)
[install-plugins] plugin 'helix@helix-constitution' is INSTALLED (verified via `claude plugin list`)
[install-plugins] done — action directives + skills are wired for this project
```

It does five things:

1. **Regenerates** every registered action's slash command for every supported
   agent, from `actions/registry.yaml`
   (`scripts/generate_agent_prefix_commands.sh`).
2. **Symlinks the other agents' commands** into their project-level command
   directories — `.gemini/commands/`, `.qwen/commands/`, `prompts/` (Codex).
   BY REFERENCE (symlink, never a copy); it **never clobbers a real file** the
   operator wrote by hand — only its own symlink or a free slot (§4).
3. **Wires the `UserPromptSubmit` prompt-expansion hook** by chaining
   `install_action_prefix.sh` — so the free-form forms (`BUG: …`, `BUG :: …`,
   `BUG ---> …`) work, not just the slash commands. Registered **exactly once**
   however many times you re-run (verified: `grep -c action_prefix_expand
   .claude/settings.json` → `1` after three consecutive installs; two would
   double-expand every prompt).
4. **Symlinks every constitution skill that has a `SKILL.md`** into
   `<project>/.claude/skills/<name>` — again BY REFERENCE (§11.4.28 / §11.4.80).
5. **Registers the local marketplace and installs the `helix` plugin** via the
   `claude plugin` CLI, then **verifies** the result with `claude plugin list`.
   It never trusts the tool's own success message (§11.4.6 / §11.4.200).

You do **not** need to run `install_action_prefix.sh` separately — step 3 chains
it. (It remains the single *owner* of that hook; see §3.)

### 1.1 Flags

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--check` | Report state (constitution side **and** project side), change nothing. Exit 0 = fully wired. |
| `--skills-only` | Link skills only; skip generation, the other agents' commands, the prompt hook, and the plugin install. |
| `--skill NAME` | Link exactly one skill (implies `--skills-only`). This is what each skill's own `register.sh` calls. |
| `--no-plugin` | Skip the marketplace/plugin step (useful on a host with no `claude` CLI). |
| `[PROJECT_ROOT]` | Positional. Defaults to `$PWD`. |

---

## 2. Verify

```bash
bash constitution/scripts/install_cli_agent_plugins.sh --check
```

Real output on a fully-wired tree:

```
[install-plugins] constitution side: marketplace + plugin manifests present; 10 command(s); 3 skill(s)
[install-plugins] project side: 3 skill symlink(s) in .claude/skills/
[install-plugins] project side: UserPromptSubmit prefix hook is registered
[install-plugins] project side: plugin 'helix' is installed + enabled
[install-plugins] VERDICT: WIRED
```

`10 command(s)` = 5 registered actions × 2 files each (`<name>.md` +
`default-<name>.md`). `3 skill(s)` = the three canonical Agent Skills.

`--check` verifies **both sides** and exits non-zero on any gap:

| Side | Checked |
|---|---|
| constitution | `marketplace.json`, `plugin.json`, ≥1 generated command, ≥1 `SKILL.md` |
| project | skill symlink count in `.claude/skills/`, the `UserPromptSubmit` hook entry in `.claude/settings.json`, the plugin installed + enabled |

**Honest boundary (§11.4.6).** When the `claude` CLI is **absent**, the plugin
state is reported as **UNKNOWN** — not as installed, not as missing. The check
never claims either way about a state it cannot resolve.

---

## 3. The two installers — one entry point, two owners

You only ever run **one** command (§1). But the split underneath is real and
load-bearing — keep it.

| Installer | Owns | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| `install_cli_agent_plugins.sh` | The **entry point**. The **commands** (the `helix` plugin + the per-agent files), the **skills**, and it **chains** the hook installer below. | The one command you run; the one the post-update hook calls automatically. |
| `install_action_prefix.sh` | The **`UserPromptSubmit` prompt-expansion hook** entry in `<project>/.claude/settings.json` (pointing at `constitution/scripts/hooks/action_prefix_expand.sh` — by reference, never copied). A backup is written to `settings.json.bak` first. It is genuinely idempotent (it refuses to append a hook command it already finds). | It stays the **single owner** of that hook. The `helix` plugin deliberately ships **no** hook: if both the plugin and this installer registered one, every prompt would be **double-expanded**. Commands and prompt-expansion are owned by different installers on purpose — **do not add a hook to the plugin.** |

You *may* still run `install_action_prefix.sh` directly (e.g. to re-wire only the
hook); it is safe and idempotent. It is simply no longer a required second step.

---

## 4. How each agent discovers the commands

All four are wired **automatically** by the one install command (§1).

| Agent | Discovery path | Source it is linked from |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | The plugin `helix` from the local marketplace `helix-constitution`. Exposed as `/<name>`, `/helix:<name>`, `/default-<name>`. | `plugins/helix/commands/*.md` — the generator writes them straight into the plugin tree (single source of truth, no copy). |
| **Gemini CLI** | `.gemini/commands/*.toml` | `actions/generated/gemini/` |
| **Qwen Code** | `.qwen/commands/*.toml` | `actions/generated/qwen/` |
| **Codex CLI** | `prompts/*.md` | `actions/generated/codex/` |

`link_agent_commands()` creates one **symlink per command file** — BY REFERENCE,
never a copy (§11.4.28 / §11.4.80). It **never clobbers a real file**: it replaces
only its own symlink or fills a free slot, and WARNs (leaving it untouched) if a
hand-written file already sits at that name. Because the links point at the
generated files, an **edited expansion** is picked up with no re-link; re-running
the installer is only needed when an action is **added or removed**.

The Codex destination is `prompts/` — the convention declared by the repo's own
`actions/generated/README.md`.

**Honest boundary (§11.4.6).** Those three agents have **no pre-submit hook**, so
the free-form forms (`BUG: …`, `BUG :: …`, `BUG ---> …`) are handled there by
LAYER 1 — the model reading the §11.4.140 block in its context carrier
(`GEMINI.md` / `QWEN.md` / `AGENTS.md`) — not by a hook. Only Claude Code gets
the deterministic `UserPromptSubmit` expansion.

---

## 5. Auto-load on constitution pull (§11.4.164)

`scripts/post_update_hook.sh` is the auto-propagation seam. After a
`git pull` / `git submodule update` inside the constitution, run it (or wire it
into the project's post-merge hook):

```bash
bash constitution/scripts/post_update_hook.sh
```

It diffs `ORIG_HEAD..HEAD` (falling back to `HEAD~1`), classifies every changed
file, and — when anything under **`actions/**`, `plugins/**`, `.claude-plugin/**`,
or `skills/**`** changed — runs `install_cli_agent_plugins.sh` (STEP 4b). So a new
directive added upstream appears in your project on the next pull, with no manual
step. It also installs skills, merges MCP configs, installs git hooks, and
`bash -n`-validates every touched script.

---

## 6. Adding a NEW directive — a registry row, never code

This is the whole point of the design: **no code changes anywhere.**

1. **Add a row** to `constitution/actions/registry.yaml`:

   ```yaml
     - name: TRIAGE
       version: 1
       namespaces: [DEFAULT]
       slash_bare: auto              # bare /triage honored unless a host built-in collides
       slash_conflicts: []           # declare any known host collision here, as data
       summary: >-
         Triage an incoming report — classify severity, assign a priority, and
         schedule it without starting the fix.
       expansion: >-
         TRIAGE DIRECTIVE — the remainder of this prompt is an item to triage.
         Classify its severity from captured evidence (never a guess), assign a
         priority, and record the decision. Do NOT start the fix.
       rules:
         - "The expansion REPLACES the 'TRIAGE' prefix in any of its forms; the remainder is the item."
       composes_with:
         - "11.4.6"
   ```

   Field semantics: [REFERENCE.md §3.3](REFERENCE.md#33-actions-fields).

2. **Regenerate:**

   ```bash
   bash constitution/scripts/generate_agent_prefix_commands.sh
   ```

   This emits, for the new action: `plugins/helix/commands/triage.md` +
   `default-triage.md`, `actions/generated/{gemini,qwen}/triage.toml` +
   `default-triage.toml`, `actions/generated/codex/triage.md` +
   `default-triage.md`, and it regenerates both READMEs so the inventory cannot
   drift.

3. **Re-wire** (picks up the new plugin command):

   ```bash
   bash constitution/scripts/install_cli_agent_plugins.sh
   ```

The new directive is now live in **every** form on Claude Code —
`TRIAGE: …`, `TRIAGE :: …`, `DEFAULT::TRIAGE :: …`, `TRIAGE ---> …`,
`/triage …`, `/helix:triage …`, `/default-triage …` — with no code touched
anywhere.

### 6.1 If the new name collides with a host command

Declare it as **data**, do not work around it:

```yaml
    slash_conflicts: [triage]
```

The generator then emits an explicit `CONFLICT` comment inside
`plugins/helix/commands/triage.md` and a warning row in the plugin README, and
the bare `/triage` is left to the host. Users invoke `/helix:triage` or
`/default-triage`. The plugin must **never** silently shadow a host command.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

### A command does not appear in Claude Code

```bash
bash constitution/scripts/generate_agent_prefix_commands.sh   # regenerate
bash constitution/scripts/install_cli_agent_plugins.sh        # re-install + verify
claude plugin list | grep helix                               # must list the plugin
```

If `claude plugin list` does not show `helix`, the installer will have said so
(it verifies, it does not assume). Run the two commands it prints and read the
error.

### A bare `/name` runs the wrong thing

It collides with a host built-in. That is by design — see §6.1 and
[USER_GUIDE §5](USER_GUIDE.md#5-the-collision-bug-vs-helixbug-vs-default-bug).
Use `/helix:<name>` or `/default-<name>`. If the collision is **not yet declared**
in the registry, add it to `slash_conflicts:` and regenerate, so the command file
and the README warn about it.

### A skill does not load

- It must have a **`SKILL.md`** (uppercase). Directories with only a lowercase
  `skill.md` or only a `register.sh` are **legacy** and are deliberately skipped —
  the installer reports the skipped count. Four such legacy directories exist
  (`media-validator`, `scheduled-work-queue`, `session-sync`, `multitrack`); they
  are not part of this system.
- Check the symlink: `ls -l .claude/skills/`. If a **real directory** (not a
  symlink) is sitting at that path, the installer refuses to touch it and warns —
  remove it and re-run.

### A command file was left untouched (WARN)

`link_agent_commands()` found a **real file** (not its own symlink) at that name
and refused to overwrite it — your hand-written command wins. Rename or remove it
and re-run if you want the generated one.

### The `claude` CLI is absent

Not an error, and not faked. The installer says so and prints the exact one-time
commands:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add ./constitution
claude plugin install helix@helix-constitution
```

Everything else still completes — generation, the other agents' command links,
the prompt hook, and the skills. Gemini / Qwen / Codex do not need the `claude`
CLI at all, and `--check` reports the plugin state as **UNKNOWN** rather than
guessing.

### Prompts are expanded twice

Something added a `UserPromptSubmit` hook to the plugin, **or** a second hook
entry was appended to `.claude/settings.json` by hand. Check:

```bash
grep -c action_prefix_expand .claude/settings.json   # MUST be exactly 1
```

The plugin must ship **commands only**; the prompt-expansion hook belongs to
`install_action_prefix.sh`, which registers it exactly once (§3).

### An unregistered `NAME:` line did nothing

Correct. The single-colon form is **registered-action-only**: an unknown token in
that form is a NO-OP, because `NOTE:` / `TODO:` / `WARNING:` / `FIXME:` share the
shape. The other five forms **ask** on an unknown token. See
[REFERENCE §4.6](REFERENCE.md#46-unknown-grammar-shaped-tokens).

### Sub-system shortcuts do not resolve

They require `python3` **and** `PyYAML`; without them the token falls through to
ASK. Behavioural actions are unaffected (they have an awk fallback). An
**ambiguous** token (two sub-systems) is deliberately dropped rather than guessed.

---

## 8. Fixed defects (changelog)

### `post_update_hook.sh` — `detect_changes()` lost every change (FIXED)

**Symptom.** A constitution pull that changed skills / actions / plugins installed
**nothing**, silently. The hook reported "no changes" and exited 0.

**Root cause.** `detect_changes()` fed its classification loop from a **pipe**:

```bash
printf '%s\n' "$changed_files" | while IFS= read -r f; do CHANGED_SKILLS+=("$f"); done
```

In bash a `cmd | while …` loop body runs in a **subshell**, so every `+=` was
discarded when that subshell exited. The caller then saw **empty arrays**
(reproduced probe: `AFTER-LOOP count = 0`).

**Fix.** Process substitution keeps the loop in the current shell:

```bash
done < <(printf '%s\n' "$changed_files")
```

The script now carries a comment at that exact line explaining why it must never
be re-piped (§11.4.201 — a guard must assert the REAL condition; a hook that
silently installs nothing is a FAIL-open bluff).

**Verify the fix on your own tree** by changing a registry row, committing inside
the constitution, and running `bash constitution/scripts/post_update_hook.sh` — it
must report `1 action/plugin file(s) changed` and run STEP 4b.

## 9. Uninstall

Nothing is copied into the project, so removal is just unlinking:

```bash
# 1. the plugin
claude plugin uninstall helix@helix-constitution
claude plugin marketplace remove helix-constitution

# 2. the skills (symlinks only — the sources stay in the constitution)
rm -f .claude/skills/action-prefix-system \
      .claude/skills/reporting-workable-items \
      .claude/skills/workable-item-lifecycle

# 3. the prompt-expansion hook — remove the UserPromptSubmit entry that references
#    constitution/scripts/hooks/action_prefix_expand.sh
#    (a backup from install time is at .claude/settings.json.bak)
$EDITOR .claude/settings.json

# 4. the other agents' commands (symlinks the installer created — §4)
find .gemini/commands .qwen/commands prompts -maxdepth 1 -type l -delete 2>/dev/null
```

Deleting only symlinks (`-type l`) leaves any hand-written command file of your
own in place.

The constitution submodule itself is untouched — the generated files under
`actions/generated/` and `plugins/helix/commands/` are regenerated artifacts and
can be left in place.
