## 1. TDD Philosophy

### 1.1 Core Tenet

Test-Driven Development for the SpecKit-Superpowers bridge system follows the immutable cycle:

```
RED ──→ GREEN ──→ REFACTOR ──→ (repeat)
```

Every nano-task — regardless of size, language, or domain — MUST pass through all three phases in strict order. This is not a guideline. It is a mechanical enforcement gate implemented by the `implementation-gate.js` file that gates every SpecKit `tasks.md` execution.

### 1.2 Why TDD for EVERY Nano-Task

The bridge system decomposes user-facing features into sub-sub-sub-N-layer nano-tasks. Each nano-task is intentionally small enough that a modest local LLM can execute it correctly. This extreme granularity would be a BLUFF if tests came after — because:

1. **A task without a test is a claim without evidence** (§11.4.123). If the test is written after the implementation, it proves only that the test agrees with the code — never that the test catches broken behaviour (§11.4.43 PASS-bluff at the TDD layer).
2. **A nano-task without RED-before-GREEN is unvalidated instrumentation** (§11.4.115(F)). The implementation gate must observe the test FAIL before the implementation exists. A guard never observed FAILing does not satisfy the custody chain (§11.4.146(D3)).
3. **Refactoring without a passing test is gambling**. The test is the anchor that proves the behaviour is preserved through structural changes.

### 1.3 Per-Language Binding

TDD applies to ALL executable surfaces in the bridge ecosystem:

| Work Product | TDD Artifact |
|---|---|
| TypeScript/JavaScript (SuperBridge MCP server) | Jest/Vitest `.test.ts` |
| Go (Helix LLM Gateway, DAG Engine) | `go test` `_test.go` files |
| Bash (tooling scripts, helpers) | Executing test through the script's REAL invocation path asserting exit + output + state delta (§11.4.224(A)) |
| Configuration (YAML/JSON manifests) | Schema validation test with golden-good/golden-bad fixtures |
| Pre-build gate | Paired §1.1 mutation authored FIRST, observed to FAIL the gate |

Documentation-only changes and governance prose are NOT coverage-scoped (§11.4.224(F)) but MUST pass §11.4.142 independent review.

---

## 2. RED Phase Specification

### 2.1 Mechanical Requirements

The RED phase is gated by `implementation-gate.js` with the following invariants:

**(a) Test Written FIRST.** The test file MUST be authored and committed BEFORE any implementation file for the nano-task. The gate checks file timestamps or git history ordering.

**(b) Test Executed FIRST.** The test MUST be run before the implementation exists. The gate captures the test runner's exit code and output.

**(c) Test Observed to FAIL.** The gate REQUIRES a non-zero exit code from the test runner. A test that passes before implementation is a TAUTOLOGY — it does not catch the gap, and the gate refuses it with `RED_FAILED: test passed before implementation — tautology detected`.

**(d) Captured Evidence of RED.** Every RED phase produces a machine-written verdict file:

```json
{
  "item_id": "ATM-512",
  "guard_identity": "test_nano_task_stdlib_sha256",
  "polarity": "RED",
  "exit_code": 1,
  "target_fingerprint": "sha256:abc123def456",
  "iterations": 3,
  "evidence_class": "source",
  "evidence_files": ["qa-results/run-512/RED_stdout.txt", "qa-results/run-512/RED_stderr.txt"],
  "precondition_provenance": "observed",
  "timestamp": "2026-07-24T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### 2.2 RED MUST NOT Be a Tautology

The implementation gate rejects RED attempts where:

- The test asserts `true === true` or equivalent assertion-free structure.
- The test only checks that a file exists without checking behaviour.
- The test passes with exit 0 before implementation (proves it doesn't test the gap).
- The test's assertion is structurally unable to fail (e.g. `expect(1).toBe(1)`).
- The test's mutation (§1.1 paired mutation) does NOT make the gate FAIL.

Detection mechanism: the gate runs the test in a sandboxed environment where the implementation module is stubbed to throw `NotImplementedError`. If the test does not fail with a meaningful assertion error (not merely a module-not-found error that would exist after implementation too), it is rejected.

### 2.3 `implementation-gate.js` RED Enforcement

The gate's RED enforcement logic:

```text
1. Receive nano-task spec (item_id, test_files[], impl_files[])
2. Verify test files exist and impl files do NOT yet exist
3. Run test runner (jest/vitest/go test/bash)
4. Capture exit code
5. If exit_code === 0 → REJECT "RED_FAILED: tautology — test passed before implementation"
6. If exit_code !== 0 AND error matches expected pattern → ACCEPT "RED_PASS"
7. Write RED verdict file to qa-results/<run-id>/verdicts/RED_<item_id>.json
8. Record in evidence store
```

### 2.4 RED Verdict Lifecycle

The RED verdict is immutable once written. It serves as the `prior RED` artifact that the GREEN phase gate checks. A GREEN verdict without a matching RED verdict for the same `item_id` is REJECTED by the GREEN-phase gate.

---

## 3. GREEN Phase Specification

### 3.1 Mechanical Requirements

**(a) Implementation Makes Test Pass.** After the implementation file is authored, the test is re-run. The gate captures the exit code: exit 0 with all assertions passing = GREEN.

**(b) GREEN REQUIRES Prior RED Artifact.** The gate reads `qa-results/<run-id>/verdicts/RED_<item_id>.json`. If it does not exist, the GREEN verdict is REFUSED:

```
GREEN_REJECTED: no prior RED verdict found for item ATM-512.
Every GREEN requires a prior RED observed-to-fail on the pre-implementation artifact.
TDD must be followed: RED first, GREEN second.
```

**(c) Different Artifact Fingerprint Required.** The target fingerprint in the GREEN verdict MUST differ from the RED verdict's fingerprint. Identical fingerprints prove the fix was never deployed (§11.4.115(F)). The gate computes `sha256(item_id + impl_file_contents + test_file_contents)` for both phases and asserts they differ.

**(d) DETERMINISTIC Consistency (§11.4.50).** The GREEN test MUST pass N=3 iterations (N=10 for cycle-validation suites) on the same target with identical exit codes.

### 3.2 GREEN Verdict Output

```json
{
  "item_id": "ATM-512",
  "guard_identity": "test_nano_task_stdlib_sha256",
  "polarity": "GREEN",
  "exit_code": 0,
  "target_fingerprint": "sha256:def789abc012",
  "iterations": 3,
  "evidence_class": "source",
  "evidence_files": ["qa-results/run-512/GREEN_stdout.txt"],
  "prior_red_verdict": "qa-results/run-512/verdicts/RED_ATM-512.json",
  "timestamp": "2026-07-24T12:05:00Z"
}
```

### 3.3 `implementation-gate.js` GREEN Enforcement

```text
1. Receive nano-task spec (item_id, test_files[], impl_files[])
2. Verify impl files now exist
3. Check for prior RED verdict: qa-results/<run-id>/verdicts/RED_<item_id>.json
4. If absent → REJECT "GREEN_REJECTED: no prior RED verdict"
5. Read RED verdict, extract target_fingerprint
6. Run test runner
7. If exit_code !== 0 → REJECT "GREEN_FAILED: test did not pass"
8. Compute current fingerprint
9. If current_fingerprint === RED_fingerprint → REJECT "GREEN_FAILED: identical fingerprint — fix not deployed"
10. Run N=3 iterations, assert all exit 0 with identical hashes
11. Write GREEN verdict file
12. Record in evidence store
```

---

## 4. REFACTOR Phase Specification

### 4.1 Safety Guarantees

The REFACTOR phase allows structural improvements after GREEN:

**(a) Test MUST Stay GREEN Through Refactor.** Every refactor commit MUST re-run the test. If the test transitions from GREEN to RED during refactor, the refactor introduced a regression and MUST be reverted or fixed.

**(b) Permitted Refactor Operations:**
- Performance improvements (algorithmic complexity reduction)
- Readability improvements (naming, structure, decomposition)
- Safety improvements (error handling, input validation, bounds checking)
- Memory/resource efficiency (reduced allocations, freed resources)

**(c) Forbidden During Refactor:**
- Behaviour changes that alter the contract tested by the GREEN phase
- New feature additions (these start a new RED phase)
- Silent weakening of assertions (a §11.4.120 reconciliation violation)

### 4.2 Refactor Verdict

```json
{
  "item_id": "ATM-512",
  "polarity": "REFACTOR",
  "pre_refactor_green_verdict": "qa-results/run-512/verdicts/GREEN_ATM-512.json",
  "post_refactor_exit_code": 0,
  "iterations": 3,
  "evidence_files": ["qa-results/run-512/REFACTOR_stdout.txt"],
  "timestamp": "2026-07-24T12:10:00Z"
}
```

## 5. Anti-Bluff Verification

### 5.1 Metadata-Only PASS Forbidden

A test whose PASS is based solely on file existence, config presence, grep-hit counts, or "no error" exit codes WITHOUT captured runtime evidence is a §11.4 PASS-bluff. The implementation gate enforces this by requiring that every GREEN verdict carries:

1. **The test's OWN assertion output** (not merely the test runner's exit code).
2. **For user-visible features:** §11.4.107 liveness evidence (frame-advance counter, freeze-detection oracle, per-channel RMS for audio).
3. **For API/infrastructure tasks:** Real round-trip evidence (actual HTTP response, actual DB query result, actual file system state).
4. **For config/static data tasks:** Schema-validated parsing output with golden-good/golden-bad fixtures.

### 5.2 Self-Validating Oracle

Every test harness that produces a PASS/FAIL verdict MUST be self-validated with:

**(a) Golden-Good Fixture.** A known-correct artifact that MUST produce PASS. If the oracle fails the golden-good, the ORACLE is broken.

**(b) Golden-Bad Fixture.** A known-broken artifact that MUST produce FAIL. If the oracle passes the golden-bad, the ORACLE is a BLUFF (§11.4.107(10)).

**(c) Negative-Control Fixture.** Two genuinely DIFFERENT artifacts that MUST NOT be conflated. An oracle that merges them is a false-merge engine (§11.4.214).

These fixtures are wired into the meta-test (`meta_test_false_positive_proof.sh`) so the oracle's own validity is mechanically verified at every pre-build sweep.

### 5.3 `verify_anti_bluff` MCP Tool

The SuperBridge MCP server exposes a `verify_anti_bluff` tool:

```typescript
// MCP tool: verify_anti_bluff
{
  name: "verify_anti_bluff",
  description: "Verify a nano-task's TDD verdict is anti-bluff compliant per §11.4.115(F) / §11.4.146(D3)",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      item_id:      { type: "string", description: "ATM-NNN or SPK-NNN identifier" },
      red_verdict:  { type: "string", description: "Path to RED verdict JSON" },
      green_verdict:{ type: "string", description: "Path to GREEN verdict JSON" }
    },
    required: ["item_id", "red_verdict", "green_verdict"]
  }
}
```

Implementation logic:

```typescript
async function verify_anti_bluff(args: { item_id: string; red_verdict: string; green_verdict: string }) {
  const red = JSON.parse(await fs.readFile(args.red_verdict, 'utf-8'));
  const green = JSON.parse(await fs.readFile(args.green_verdict, 'utf-8'));

  const findings: string[] = [];

  if (red.exit_code === 0) {
    findings.push("RED_BLUFF: RED test passed — tautology: never observed to fail");
  }
  if (red.target_fingerprint === green.target_fingerprint) {
    findings.push("GREEN_BLUFF: Identical fingerprints — fix was never deployed, GREEN on old artifact");
  }
  if (red.item_id !== green.item_id) {
    findings.push("MISMATCH: RED and GREEN verdicts are for different items");
  }
  if (!green.prior_red_verdict) {
    findings.push("MISSING_RED: GREEN verdict lacks prior RED reference");
  }
  if (red.iterations < 3) {
    findings.push("NONDETERMINISTIC: RED executed <3 iterations (§11.4.50)");
  }
  if (green.iterations < 3) {
    findings.push("NONDETERMINISTIC: GREEN executed <3 iterations (§11.4.50)");
  }
  if (red.evidence_files.length === 0 || green.evidence_files.length === 0) {
    findings.push("NO_EVIDENCE: Verdict lacks captured-evidence file paths (§11.4.69)");
  }
  for (const f of [...red.evidence_files, ...green.evidence_files]) {
    try {
      const stat = await fs.stat(f);
      if (stat.size === 0) {
        findings.push(`EMPTY_EVIDENCE: Evidence file ${f} is 0 bytes (§11.4.5)`);
      }
    } catch {
      findings.push(`MISSING_EVIDENCE: Evidence file ${f} not found`);
    }
  }

  return {
    content: [{
      type: "text",
      text: findings.length === 0
        ? `PASS: ${args.item_id} — anti-bluff verified (RED→GREEN, distinct fingerprints, ≥3 iters, evidence present)`
        : `FAIL: ${args.item_id} — ${findings.length} bluff(s) found:\n${findings.map(f => `  - ${f}`).join('\n')}`
    }]
  };
}
```

## 6. Per-Nano-Task Test Template

### 6.1 Go Template

```go
package nano_task

import (
    "testing"
    "os"
    "encoding/json"
)

// TestNanoTask_ATM512_StdlibSHA256 is the TDD guard for nano-task ATM-512.
// RED_MODE=1: asserts the defect/gap is present (no implementation yet).
// RED_MODE=0: asserts the implementation is correct.
func TestNanoTask_ATM512_StdlibSHA256(t *testing.T) {
    redMode := os.Getenv("RED_MODE")
    if redMode == "" {
        redMode = "1" // default: RED — assert broken/absent
    }

    input := "hello world"
    expected := "b94d27b9934d3e08a52e52d7da7dabfac484efe37a5380ee9088f7ace2efcde9"

    result, err := StdlibSHA256(input)

    if redMode == "1" {
        // RED: expecting failure — implementation not yet built
        if err == nil && result == expected {
            t.Fatalf("RED_TAUTOLOGY: implementation returned correct result before RED phase. The test is not catching the gap. Is the implementation already present?")
        }
        // RED PASS: implementation absent or broken — the expected state
        t.Logf("RED_PASS: stdlib_sha256 correctly reports broken/absent in RED mode (err=%v, result=%q)", err, result)
        return
    }

    // GREEN: implementation must be correct
    if err != nil {
        t.Fatalf("GREEN_FAILED: stdlib_sha256 returned error: %v", err)
    }
    if result != expected {
        t.Fatalf("GREEN_FAILED: stdlib_sha256(%q) = %q, want %q", input, result, expected)
    }
    t.Logf("GREEN_PASS: stdlib_sha256(%q) = %q", input, result)
}
```

### 6.2 TypeScript Template

```typescript
// test_nano_task_ATM512_stdlib_sha256.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect, beforeAll } from 'vitest';

const RED_MODE = process.env.RED_MODE || '1';

describe('NanoTask ATM-512: StdlibSHA256', () => {
  let sut: typeof import('../src/atm512_stdlib_sha256').StdlibSHA256;

  beforeAll(async () => {
    try {
      const mod = await import('../src/atm512_stdlib_sha256');
      sut = mod.StdlibSHA256;
    } catch {
      sut = undefined as any;
    }
  });

  const input = 'hello world';
  const expected = 'b94d27b9934d3e08a52e52d7da7dabfac484efe37a5380ee9088f7ace2efcde9';

  it('TDD guard: RED=tests defect absence, GREEN=tests implementation', () => {
    if (RED_MODE === '1') {
      // RED phase: implementation should be absent or broken
      if (sut === undefined) {
        // Expected: module not yet created
        console.log('RED_PASS: stdlib_sha256 module not yet implemented');
        return;
      }

      let result: string | undefined;
      let threw = false;
      try {
        result = sut(input);
      } catch {
        threw = true;
      }

      if (!threw && result === expected) {
        throw new Error(
          'RED_TAUTOLOGY: implementation returned correct result before RED phase. ' +
          'The test is not catching the gap. Is the implementation already present?'
        );
      }
      console.log('RED_PASS: stdlib_sha256 correctly reports broken/absent in RED mode');
      return;
    }

    // GREEN phase: implementation must be correct
    if (sut === undefined) {
      throw new Error('GREEN_FAILED: stdlib_sha256 module not found');
    }
    const result = sut(input);
    expect(result).toBe(expected);
    console.log(`GREEN_PASS: stdlib_sha256("${input}") = "${result}"`);
  });
});
```

### 6.3 Bash Template

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
# Test: test_nano_task_ATM512_helper_script.sh
# §11.4.224(A): Executing test through REAL invocation path.

RED_MODE="${RED_MODE:-1}"

    exit 1
fi

echo "GREEN_PASS: $SCRIPT_UNDER_TEST correctly produced '$output'"
```

---

## 7. Test Coverage Requirements

### 7.1 Minimum Coverage Floor

Per §11.4.224(B): **≥85% line coverage, ~100% target**, applying to ALL executable code in the bridge ecosystem:

| Language | Instrument | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Go | `go test -coverprofile` + `go tool cover` | Built-in, measures per-function and per-line |
| TypeScript | `vitest --coverage` (c8/istanbul) | Branch and line coverage |
| Bash | `PS4='+COV:${BASH_SOURCE##*/}:${LINENO}:' bash -x` | Line coverage only; branch coverage needs `kcov` |
| Config (YAML/JSON) | Schema validation with golden fixtures | Full schema coverage, no uncovered properties |

### 7.2 RED-Capable Tests Only

Per the §11.4.224 amended contract: the measured numerator counts ONLY RED-CAPABLE tests — every contributing test carries a recorded failing-first run OR a paired mutation observed to make it FAIL. Zero-assertion contributors are REJECTED by construction. A single RED-proven test plus 84% assertion-free padding → gate FAILs.

### 7.3 Exclusion List

Corpus exclusions are legal ONLY via a CHECKED-IN exclusion list, each entry justified from the closed class set:

- `generated-code` — output of a committed generator per §11.4.77
- `vendored-third-party` — unmodified third-party libraries
- `non-shipping-fixtures-and-golden-assets` — test fixtures, golden files

First-party exclusions additionally REQUIRE a tracked §11.4.197 item.

---

## 8. Integration with Systematic Debugging

### 8.1 Auto-Trigger on RED Failure

When a RED test fails UNEXPECTEDLY (i.e., the test was supposed to fail in a specific way but failed differently), the `implementation-gate.js` auto-triggers `superpowers:systematic-debugging` per §11.4.102(D):

```typescript
async function handleRedFailure(item_id: string, redVerdict: RedVerdict, testOutput: string) {
  const expectedFailurePattern = extractExpectedPattern(redVerdict);
  const actualFailure = testOutput;

  if (!actualFailure.match(expectedFailurePattern)) {
    // UNEXPECTED RED failure — not the anticipated gap
    console.log(`§11.4.102(D): Auto-activating systematic-debugging for ${item_id}`);

    await dispatchSystematicDebugging({
      item_id,
      phase: "RED",
      expected: expectedFailurePattern,
      actual: actualFailure,
      red_verdict: redVerdict
    });
  }
}
```

### 8.2 Debugging Integration Contract

When systematic-debugging is auto-activated:

1. The current TDD pipeline PAUSES the nano-task (marks it `crashed`/`in-flight` per §11.4.147).
2. Systematic-debugging investigates: Is the test wrong? Is the gap description wrong? Is there a deeper defect?
3. The nano-task is RESUMED only after debugging produces a CLEAN root-cause finding.
4. A spurious failure without root cause → re-enters the §11.4.114/.115 isolate→RED→fix loop.

## 9. Constitutional Binding

This TDD integration document binds to the following constitution anchors:

| Anchor | What It Mandates | How This Document Satisfies It |
|---|---|---|
| **§11.4.43** | TDD-fix-discipline: RED→LIVE-ADB→GREEN→VERIFY→DOCUMENT | All five steps mechanized in `implementation-gate.js` |
| **§11.4.115** | RED-baseline-on-the-broken-artifact + polarity switch | `RED_MODE` env var, RED-then-GREEN verdict chain |
| **§11.4.224** | TDD for ALL work, not only fixes; ≥85% coverage floor | Coverage gate wired; bash scripts included |
| **§11.4.146** | Reproduce-first test + same-test-confirms-fix + extend-to-all-cases | RED=STEP1, GREEN=STEP2, fan-out mandate = STEP3 |
| **§11.4.50** | Deterministic consistency: N=3 iterations, identical exit codes | Enforced in GREEN phase gate |
| **§11.4.69** | Every PASS cites captured-evidence artifact path | Embedded in verdict JSON schema |
| **§11.4.1** | FAIL-bluffs forbidden — test crashes counted as findings | Gate rejects exit-code-based-only PASS detection |
| **§11.4.6** | No-guessing mandate | All verdict fields machine-derived, never hand-typed |
| **§11.4.107(10)** | Self-validated analyzer with golden-good/golden-bad fixtures | `verify_anti_bluff` oracle self-tests |
| **§11.4.108** | Four-layer fix-verification + runtime-signature-as-done | Target fingerprint comparison in GREEN phase |
| **§11.4.102(D)** | Automatic systematic-debugging activation | Auto-triggered on unexpected RED failure |
| **§11.4.147** | Crashed-agent respawn-until-complete | Nano-task pause/resume on debugging activation |
| **§11.4.135** | Standing regression-guard suite | Every nano-task's GREEN becomes a permanent guard |
| **§11.4.146(D3)** | Status-custody: done-status requires RED+GREEN verdict pair | Gate refuses GREEN without prior RED |
