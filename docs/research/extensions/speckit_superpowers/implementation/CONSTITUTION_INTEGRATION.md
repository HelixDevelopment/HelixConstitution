## §1. Three-Layer Governance Model

The Helix Constitution operates a three-layer rule hierarchy (§11.4.17, §11.4.35).
Every project incorporating the constitution as a git submodule inherits rules
from all three layers, with lower layers tightening (never weakening) higher ones.

### How a CLI agent resolves rules

When an agent's working directory is `<project>/sub/module/`, it walks **upward**
reading each governance file it finds, stacking rules from most-specific (deepest)
to most-general (repo root), then finally the constitution submodule:

```
</mnt/track1/atmosphere-t1/sub/module/CLAUDE.md>     ← Layer 3 (deepest)
</mnt/track1/atmosphere-t1/CLAUDE.md>                 ← Layer 2 (project)
</mnt/track1/atmosphere-t1/constitution/CLAUDE.md>    ← Layer 1 (universal)
```

The SpecKit-Superpowers Bridge anchor (§11.4.NNB) lives at **Layer 1** — every
project inherits it automatically. Project-specific configuration (DB paths,
hardware specs, LLM preferences, design tokens) lives at **Layer 2** as data
the engine consumes.

---

## §2. New Constitution Anchor Proposal — SpecKit-Superpowers Lifecycle

### Proposed anchor number

`§11.4.NNB` — placeholder; the actual number is assigned by the constitution
maintainer on landing. The next free number in the §11.4 sequence is requested.

### Anchor text

**§11.4.NNB — SpecKit-Superpowers Bridge lifecycle: every governed project MUST ship the bridge as a core technology stack, auto-discovered from the constitution submodule, driving specify→plan→tasks→implement→review through constitutionally-bound nano-task layers with decoupled subagent execution and full TDD coverage (User mandate, 2026-07-24).**

The SpecKit-Superpowers Bridge is a **constitutionally-bound core technology
stack** — derived to every consuming project from the constitution submodule —
that orchestrates the full feature-development lifecycle from specification
through delivery. It is NOT an optional plugin, NOT a per-project re-
implementation, and NOT a carve-out from any existing constitutional mandate.

**(A) Bridge lifecycle.** Every governed feature passes through the 6-stage
bridge pipeline:

1. **SPECIFY** — a natural-language feature description becomes a formal
   `spec.md` (from the `speckit-specify` skill). The spec carries §11.4.44
   revision header + §11.4.91 ≥40-char meaningful descriptions for every
   sub-section. It is exported to `.html`+`.pdf`+`.docx` per §11.4.65.

2. **CLARIFY** — underspecified areas are identified and the operator is asked
   ≤5 highly targeted questions per §11.4.66 interactive-clarification
   mechanism; answers are encoded back into the spec (the `speckit-clarify`
   skill).

3. **PLAN** — a `plan.md` is generated (the `speckit-plan` skill), containing
   architecture, data-flow, contract definitions, and a constitution-compliance
   cross-check enumerating every applicable §-letter with per-section coverage.
   The plan cites §11.4.8 research references AND §11.4.150 multi-angle deep-
   research passes for every non-trivial design decision. The plan is run
   through the `speckit-analyze` skill for non-destructive cross-artifact
   consistency analysis per §11.4.186 consistency enforcement.

4. **TASKS** — a `tasks.md` is generated (the `speckit-tasks` skill),
   decomposed into the **finest granularity decoupled nano-tasks** the bridge
   can produce. Every task is: (i) independently implementable by a single
   subagent (§11.4.20 / §11.4.70) with zero coupling to any other in-flight
   task; (ii) preceded by its own RED test (§11.4.43 TDD-fix-discipline,
   §11.4.115 RED-baseline-on-the-broken-artifact, §11.4.224 test-first for
   ALL work); (iii) scoped to ≤30 minutes wall-clock (§11.4.82(G) subagent
   scope discipline); (iv) carrying explicit dependency edges to other tasks
   (a DAG) so assembly tasks bind results without re-executing; (v) registered
   as a tracked workable item (§11.4.54 ATM-NNN id, §11.4.15 Status=Queued,
   §11.4.16 Type=Task) in the project's SQLite SSoT (§11.4.93/§11.4.95).

5. **IMPLEMENT** — tasks execute through the `speckit-implement` skill via
   subagent-driven development (§11.4.70), each subagent running in an
   isolated `git worktree` (§11.4.58 L4 / §11.4.84), registered in the
   agent-lifecycle tracker (§11.4.147 crashed-agent respawn), with every
   closure landing four-layer test coverage (§11.4.4(b): pre-build gate +
   post-build gate + on-device runtime test + paired §1.1 mutation).

6. **REVIEW** — the implemented batch passes through the full review gauntlet:
   independent code-review on Fable-xhigh (§11.4.125 / §11.4.142 / §11.4.209),
   iterated to ZERO findings + ZERO warnings (§11.4.134), with §11.4.194
   exhaustive all-scenario analysis and §11.4.145 eight-angle impact research.

**(B) Nano-task decoupling.** Tasks are decomposed to the **smallest self-
contained work unit** the language and feature permit — so small that even a
weaker local LLM (operating within host hardware constraints) can execute each
flawlessly. Assembly tasks compose decoupled results without re-implementing them.
The nano-task graph is layered: leaf tasks produce primitive artifacts, mid-layer
tasks compose them, and top-layer tasks wire the composed results into the
application. Every task carries explicit input/output contracts. Task-to-task
coupling is structural (declared file-scope manifest §11.4.58) — never
assumed/improvised (§11.4.6).

**(C) TDD at every layer.** The TDD cycle binds every task:

| TDD Phase | Constitutional Binding |
|---|---|
| **RED** — test FIRST, observed to FAIL | §11.4.43 step 1 + §11.4.115 `RED_MODE=1` + §11.4.224(A) |
| **GREEN** — implementation makes it pass | §11.4.43 step 3 + §11.4.115 `RED_MODE=0` polarity switch |
| **VERIFY** — re-run, deterministic consistency | §11.4.50 N=3 iters, same frozen artifact fingerprint |
| **DOCUMENT** — Issues→Fixed migration | §11.4.43 step 5 + §11.4.33 type-aware closure |

A RED authored AFTER implementation is a §11.4 PASS-bluff — the bridge MUST
produce RED-first evidence (§11.4.224(A) + §11.4.115(F) machine-written
verdict pairs).

**(D) Constitutional anti-bluff at every stage.** Every bridge stage MUST produce
captured physical evidence per §11.4.5 / §11.4.69 / §11.4.107 — metadata-only /
config-only / absence-of-error / grep-without-runtime PASS forbidden at every
layer (§11.4 / §11.4.1). The `speckit-analyze` skill's cross-artifact consistency
analysis is self-validated golden-good/golden-bad per §11.4.107(10). A bridge
stage that produces a green signal without captured evidence is a §11.4 bluff
at the lifecycle-orchestration layer.

**(E) Auto-discovery.** The bridge is inherited from the constitution submodule
as a core technology stack (§11.4.74 extend-don't-reimplement). Skills are
auto-discovered via the §11.4.164 `post_update_hook.sh` propagation seam and
registered in the consuming project's skill index. No per-project installation
step beyond `git submodule update --remote constitution` is required.

**(F) Per-project configuration.** The bridge ENGINE carries ZERO project
literals (§11.4.28 decoupling). Consuming projects supply their configuration
as DATA: LLM provider preferences, hardware capacity (cores, RAM, VRAM),
project-specific ID prefixes, tracker bindings, and design-token paths
(§11.4.35).

**(G) Composition with existing anchors.** The bridge COMPOSES — never weakens —
every anchor it touches. Its role is to mechanize what the existing anchors
mandate as prose: it takes "every fix SHALL have a RED test" and makes it
the mechanical output of the plan→tasks→implement pipeline rather than a
discipline the agent must remember.

Classification: **universal** (§11.4.17) — the SpecKit-Superpowers lifecycle
is reusable by ANY governed project, carrying zero project-specific hardware,
vendor, or region assumptions. Consuming projects supply their per-project
DATA as described in §6.

### Composition mapping

The anchor composes with (does NOT weaken, does NOT re-define):

| §-letter | What the bridge adds |
|---|---|
| §11.4.17 | Universal-vs-project — the bridge is Layer 1 (universal), per-project config is Layer 2 data |
| §11.4.20 | Subagent-driven-by-default — every IMPLEMENT task dispatches as a subagent |
| §11.4.28 | Decoupling — bridge ENGINE is project-agnostic; consumer supplies DATA |
| §11.4.35 | Canonical-root inheritance — bridge rules travel through the 3-layer hierarchy |
| §11.4.43 | TDD-fix-discipline — bridge mechanizes the RED→GREEN→VERIFY→DOCUMENT cycle |
| §11.4.50 | Deterministic consistency — bridge tasks run N=3 iterations on identical artifact |
| §11.4.58 | Parallel-development PWU — every task is a PWU with file-scope manifest |
| §11.4.66 | Interactive clarification — CLARIFY stage encodes answers back into spec |
| §11.4.70 | Subagent-driven execution — IMPLEMENT stage defaults to subagents |
| §11.4.74 | Catalogue-first — bridge skills registered in submodules-catalogue.md |
| §11.4.84 | Working-tree quiescence — tasks use isolated git worktrees |
| §11.4.85 | Stress+chaos — every fix ships with resilience tests |
| §11.4.107 | Anti-bluff AV — bridge stages produce captured evidence, not metadata-only |
| §11.4.115 | RED-baseline + polarity — every task carries `RED_MODE=1→0` |
| §11.4.125 | Code-review gate — REVIEW stage dispatches independent reviewers |
| §11.4.134 | Iterate-until-GO — REVIEW iterates to ZERO findings + ZERO warnings |
| §11.4.142 | Universal review — every task diff crosses independent review |
| §11.4.145 | Impact research — PLAN stage includes 8-angle impact analysis |
| §11.4.146 | Reproduce-first-then-extend — each task follows the 3-step workflow |
| §11.4.147 | Crashed-agent respawn — every IMPLEMENT subagent tracked in lifecycle registry |
| §11.4.150 | Deep multi-angle research — PLAN cites research passes per §11.4.8 |
| §11.4.164 | Auto-propagation — bridge skills installed via post_update_hook.sh |
| §11.4.186 | Cross-document consistency — speckit-analyze enforces spec↔plan↔tasks consistency |
| §11.4.194 | Exhaustive code-review — REVIEW covers all scenarios + captured evidence cross-check |
| §11.4.197 | Research completion — every SPECIFY→PLAN artifact maps to a tracked workable item |
| §11.4.209 | Fable-xhigh review — REVIEW dispatches on Fable model at xhigh effort |
| §11.4.224 | TDD for ALL work — every task (including new features) ships RED-first |
| §11.4.227 | Governance self-custody — the bridge anchor's named gates are registered in the ledger |

### Propagation gate name

`CM-COVENANT-114-NNB-PROPAGATION` — asserts the literal `11.4.NNB` is present
(block-start shaped per §11.4.227(B)) in every governance mirror file across
the 5-carrier lockstep set (Constitution.md + CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md + QWEN.md
+ GEMINI.md, §11.4.157).

### Recommended mechanism gates

| Gate | What it enforces |
|---|---|
| `CM-SPECKIT-BRIDGE-SKILLS-PRESENT` | All 8 bridge skills (speckit-specify, speckit-plan, speckit-tasks, speckit-implement, speckit-analyze, speckit-clarify, speckit-checklist, speckit-converge) exist + parse-clean in the constitution skills directory |
| `CM-SPECKIT-BRIDGE-AUTO-DISCOVERY` | `post_update_hook.sh` detects bridge-skill changes and registers them in consuming projects |
| `CM-SPECKIT-BRIDGE-TDD-WIRED` | Every IMPLEMENT task carries a RED-first verdict pair (§11.4.115(F)) + observed precondition-provenance field |
| `CM-SPECKIT-BRIDGE-NANO-DECOUPLING` | Task graph produces decoupled nano-tasks with explicit contracts; no task exceeds §11.4.82(G) 30-min wall-clock budget |
| `CM-SPECKIT-BRIDGE-CATALOGUE-REGISTERED` | Bridge registered in `submodules-catalogue.md` under its capability category |
| `CM-SPECKIT-BRIDGE-CONSUMER-CONFIG` | Per-project config file schema documented + `report_item.sh` validates consumer config every run |

All gates ship paired §1.1 meta-test mutations. Gate-code = separate work item
per §11.4.227(A).

## §3. Consumer Onboarding — Step-by-Step

A new project that incorporates the Helix Constitution and wants to use the
SpecKit-Superpowers Bridge follows this bootstrap sequence:

### Step 1 — Add the constitution submodule

```bash
# In the project root
git submodule add git@github.com:HelixDevelopment/helix_constitution.git constitution
cd constitution && git checkout v1.0.0 && cd ..
```

### Step 2 — Wire the inheritance pointer

```bash
echo "## INHERITED FROM ./constitution/Constitution.md" >> CLAUDE.md
echo "" >> CLAUDE.md
```

The consuming project's `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `QWEN.md`, and `GEMINI.md`
each open with this pointer. Agents walking up from the working directory read
the project's governance first, then the constitution's. The constitution's
files are authoritative for any topic the project does not cover.

### Step 3 — Run the post-update hook

```bash
bash constitution/scripts/post_update_hook.sh
```

This single invocation:
1. Detects every skill, MCP config, git hook, and action directive that changed
   since the last constitution pull (or on the initial install, treats
   everything as "new").
2. Symlinks the bridge skills (`constitution/skills/speckit-*`) into the project's
   skills directory.
3. Registers the bridge slash commands (`/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan`,
   etc.) in every CLI agent's command set.
4. Installs the git hooks that enforce §11.4.75 mechanical enforcement.
5. Validates all installed scripts (`bash -n` + `sh -n` per §11.4.67).

### Step 4 — Supply project-specific configuration

Create the consumer-owned config file at the project-declared path (§11.4.35):

```bash
mkdir -p config/speckit
```

Example `config/speckit/bridge.yaml`:

```yaml
# Per-project bridge configuration (DATA, not engine code — §11.4.28)
project:
  name: "my-project"                         # Lowercase snake_case (§11.4.29)
  prefix: "${HELIX_RELEASE_PREFIX:-my_project}"  # §11.4.151

hardware:
  cores: 64
  ram_gb: 256
  vram_gb: 32
  model: "threadripper"

llm:
  primary_provider: "local"
  local_backend: "llama.cpp"
  fallback_providers: ["anthropic", "deepseek"]
  preferred_effort: "high"

tracker:
  db_path: "docs/workable_items.db"          # §11.4.95
  id_prefix: "PROJ"                          # §11.4.54
  sync_command: "bash scripts/sync_docs.sh"  # §11.4.106 docs_chain

design:
  tokens_path: "design/opendesign/tokens.css"  # §11.4.216
  brand_colors:
    primary: "#B6E376"
    accent: "#4A90D9"
```

### Step 5 — Verify the installation

```bash
bash constitution/scripts/post_update_hook.sh --verify-only
```

This dry-run validates that all bridge skills are symlinked, all slash commands
resolve, and the consumer config parses. It exits 0 only when the installation
is complete. The consuming project's pre-build gate `CM-CONSTITUTION-PULL-VALIDATED`
(§11.4.32) runs this check automatically.

### Step 6 — Start using the bridge

From this point, the CLI agent recognizes the SpecKit-Superpowers lifecycle
automatically. The operator types:

```
/SPECKIT.SPECIFY a real-time collaborative whiteboard with WebSocket sync
```

…and the 6-stage pipeline begins: specify → clarify → plan → tasks → implement
→ review — all driven by the bridge, all constitutionally-bound, all producing
captured physical evidence at every stage.

---

## §4. Constitution Consumption Workflow

### How a CLI agent inherits rules

When an agent starts in a directory inside a governed project, it resolves
governance by walking **upward** from the working directory to the filesystem
root, reading every `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` it encounters:

```
# Agent working directory: /mnt/track1/atmosphere-t1/device/rockchip/rk3588/

1. /mnt/track1/atmosphere-t1/device/rockchip/rk3588/CLAUDE.md  ← deepest (if exists)
2. /mnt/track1/atmosphere-t1/device/rockchip/CLAUDE.md          ← parent (if exists)
3. /mnt/track1/atmosphere-t1/device/CLAUDE.md                   ← parent (if exists)
4. /mnt/track1/atmosphere-t1/CLAUDE.md                          ← project root (Layer 2)
5. /mnt/track1/atmosphere-t1/constitution/CLAUDE.md             ← constitution (Layer 1)
```

If a project-level file opens with:

```markdown
## INHERITED FROM ./constitution/Constitution.md
```

…the agent reads the constitution's file next. If a deeper file tightens a
rule (e.g., "in this subdirectory, additionally enforce X"), the tightest
rule wins per the authority hierarchy (§11.4.35).

### What the bridge adds to this flow

The bridge skills are inherited from **Layer 1** (the constitution submodule).
They are load-bearing constitution features — not project-specific add-ons.
A new project inherits all bridge capabilities the moment it runs
`post_update_hook.sh` after adding the constitution submodule.

The `find_constitution.sh` helper (shipped in the constitution submodule root)
provides the resolved path for any governed project:

```bash
CONST_DIR=$(bash constitution/find_constitution.sh)
echo "Constitution at: $CONST_DIR"
# → /mnt/track1/atmosphere-t1/constitution
```

Agents and bridge scripts read this value instead of guessing a relative path
(§11.4.6 no-guessing).

---

## §5. Extension Auto-Discovery

### The catalogue system (§11.4.74)

The constitution mandates that every reusable capability under the
`vasic-digital` + `HelixDevelopment` organizations is catalogued in
`constitution/submodules-catalogue.md`. Before scaffolding any new module,
agents MUST survey this catalogue. If a capability exists, the agent MUST
reuse or extend it — never reimplement.

### How the bridge registers

The SpecKit-Superpowers Bridge registers in the catalogue under the **AI /
Agent Tooling** category (mirroring existing entries like `LLMOrchestrator`,
`SkillRegistry`, `VisionEngine`):

```markdown
- **[`speckit-bridge`](https://github.com/HelixDevelopment/speckit-bridge)** —
  SpecKit→Superpowers lifecycle bridge: specify→plan→tasks→implement→review
  pipeline with constitutional TDD, nano-task decoupling, and subagent-driven
  execution
```

The catalogue entry is the single referent for "does a SpecKit bridge already
exist?" — agents answering that question read this entry, never re-survey GitHub
(per §11.4.74 catalogue-first).

### Skill auto-registration

The `post_update_hook.sh` (§11.4.164) detects when the constitution's
`skills/` directory gains new entries and registers them in consuming projects:

```
constitution/skills/speckit-specify/SKILL.md       →  <project>/.claude/skills/speckit-specify/
constitution/skills/speckit-plan/SKILL.md          →  <project>/.claude/skills/speckit-plan/
constitution/skills/speckit-tasks/SKILL.md         →  <project>/.claude/skills/speckit-tasks/
constitution/skills/speckit-implement/SKILL.md     →  <project>/.claude/skills/speckit-implement/
constitution/skills/speckit-analyze/SKILL.md       →  <project>/.claude/skills/speckit-analyze/
constitution/skills/speckit-clarify/SKILL.md       →  <project>/.claude/skills/speckit-clarify/
constitution/skills/speckit-checklist/SKILL.md     →  <project>/.claude/skills/speckit-checklist/
constitution/skills/speckit-converge/SKILL.md      →  <project>/.claude/skills/speckit-converge/
constitution/skills/speckit-superpowers-bridge/SKILL.md →
                                                      <project>/.claude/skills/speckit-superpowers-bridge/
```

Each symlink is validated: source exists, target is a regular file, symlink
resolves. A pre-existing directory at the target path is left untouched (never
deleted, §11.4.122).

### Slash-command generation

The `scripts/install_cli_agent_plugins.sh` helper (invoked by
`post_update_hook.sh`) generates per-agent slash commands from the
`constitution/plugins/helix/commands/` templates. The bridge extensions add
these commands:

| Command | Plugin source | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/speckit.specify` | `plugins/helix/commands/speckit-specify.md` | Start the SPECIFY stage |
| `/speckit.clarify` | `plugins/helix/commands/speckit-clarify.md` | Run the CLARIFY stage |
| `/speckit.plan` | `plugins/helix/commands/speckit-plan.md` | Run the PLAN stage |
| `/speckit.tasks` | `plugins/helix/commands/speckit-tasks.md` | Run the TASKS stage |
| `/speckit.implement` | `plugins/helix/commands/speckit-implement.md` | Run the IMPLEMENT stage |
| `/speckit.analyze` | `plugins/helix/commands/speckit-analyze.md` | Cross-artifact consistency analysis |
| `/speckit.bridge` | `plugins/helix/commands/speckit-bridge.md` | Full pipeline orchestration |

Commands are generated for every CLI agent the project supports (Claude Code,
Qwen Code, Gemini CLI — per §11.4.157). The `DEFAULT::` namespace prefix
ensures unambiguous resolution even when a host has a built-in `/specify` or
`/plan` command (§11.4.140 conflict rule).

## §6. Per-Project Configuration — DATA vs ENGINE

§11.4.28 mandates that shared submodules carry ZERO project-specific context.
The SpecKit-Superpowers Bridge follows this discipline strictly:

### What the ENGINE provides (constitution submodule, inherited by reference)

| Component | Path in constitution | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Bridge skills (8) | `skills/speckit-*/SKILL.md` | Skill definitions + workflows |
| Plugin commands | `plugins/helix/commands/speckit-*.md` | Slash-command templates |
| Lifecycle orchestrator | `scripts/speckit/bridge_lifecycle.sh` | Pipeline conductor (orchestrates 6 stages) |
| Task decomposer | `scripts/speckit/nano_task_decomposer.sh` | Produces decoupled task DAG |
| TDD harness | `scripts/speckit/tdd_harness.sh` | RED-first + verdict-pair generator |
| Spec validator | `scripts/speckit/spec_validator.sh` | Validates spec→plan→tasks consistency |
| Configuration schema | `scripts/speckit/schemas/bridge_config_schema.yaml` | JSON Schema for consumer config |
| Helix-deps manifest | `helix-deps.yaml` | Declares dependencies under §11.4.31 |

ALL of the above carry ZERO project literals — no hardcoded paths, device
serials, package names, LLM provider API keys, or region assumptions.

### What the CONSUMER supplies (project-owned DATA)

| Configuration | Example | Constitutional reference |
|---|---|---|
| DB path | `docs/workable_items.db` | §11.4.95 (tracked workable-items DB) |
| ID prefix | `ATM` → item `ATM-001` | §11.4.54 (ticket identifier) |
| Sync commands | `bash scripts/sync_issues_docs.sh` | §11.4.106 (docs_chain) |
| Tracker bindings | ClickUp list `901818394542` + field map | §11.4.148 D5 (external tracker sync) |
| Hardware capacity | `cores: 64 / ram_gb: 256 / vram_gb: 32` | §12.6 (memory budget) + §12.12 (thread limit) |
| LLM provider preferences | `primary: local / fallback: [anthropic, deepseek]` | §11.4.196 (native-alias-first priority) |
| Design tokens | `design/opendesign/tokens.css` | §11.4.216 (canonical design-token source) |
| Project name | `my_project` (snake_case) | §11.4.29 + §11.4.151 (release prefix) |
| Default assignee | `@operator_handle` from `.env` var | §11.4.104 (participant attribution) |
| Default timezone | `Europe/Moscow` | §11.4.208 (request-history timezone) |

The engine reads this configuration at runtime. It FAILS CLOSED with an
actionable error when configuration is absent — it never guesses (§11.4.6)
and never silently defaults to a hardcoded value.

### Example consumer config file

```yaml
# <project>/config/speckit/bridge.yaml — consumer-owned DATA
# Read by constitution/scripts/speckit/bridge_lifecycle.sh
# This file is TRACKED in the project (it IS authoritative source data, §11.4.95)

    sync:
      command: "bash scripts/sync_issues_docs.sh"
      on_stage_complete: true
    external:
      - service: "clickup"
        list_id: "901818394542"
        credential_env: "CLICKUP_API_TOKEN"

      web: "src/styles/tokens.css"
```

## §7. Docs Chain Integration

The SpecKit-Superpowers Bridge's output artifacts — `spec.md`, `plan.md`,
`tasks.md` — are §11.4.65-scope documents. They MUST be synchronized
through the docs_chain engine (§11.4.106):

### Documents produced by the bridge

| Document | Stage | Export formats |
|---|---|---|
| `spec.md` | SPECIFY | `.md` + `.html` + `.pdf` + `.docx` |
| `plan.md` | PLAN | `.md` + `.html` + `.pdf` + `.docx` |
| `tasks.md` | TASKS | `.md` + `.html` + `.pdf` + `.docx` |
| `report.md` | IMPLEMENT (completion) | `.md` + `.html` + `.pdf` + `.docx` |
| `review.md` | REVIEW | `.md` + `.html` + `.pdf` + `.docx` |

### docs_chain context registration

The consuming project registers a docs_chain context for bridge artifacts:

```yaml
# .docs_chain/contexts/speckit.yaml
name: speckit_outputs
description: "SpecKit bridge output synchronization"
sources:
  - path: "docs/speckit/current/spec.md"
    role: source
  - path: "docs/speckit/current/plan.md"
    role: source
  - path: "docs/speckit/current/tasks.md"
    role: source
exports:
  - format: html
    pandoc_args: ["--css", "constitution/styles/default-md.css"]
  - format: pdf
    weasyprint_args: ["--stylesheet", "constitution/styles/default-pdf.css"]
  - format: docx
fingerprint:
  method: sha256
  sidecar: "docs/speckit/current/.fingerprint"
```

### Freshness enforcement

The §11.4.86 drift-proof fingerprint ensures that when any bridge artifact
changes, the exports are regenerated before the next commit. The pre-build
gate `CM-DOCS-EXPORT-SYNC` (§11.4.60) catches any stale export regardless
of how the change was made. The §11.4.75 pre-commit git hook refuses a commit
that touches `spec.md`/`plan.md`/`tasks.md` without also touching their
`.html`/`.pdf`/`.docx` siblings.

---

## §8. Auto-Propagation Hook

### How `post_update_hook.sh` registers bridge capabilities

The §11.4.164 `post_update_hook.sh` is invoked by every consumer after every
constitution pull. It detects what changed and registers it. For the
SpecKit-Superpowers Bridge, the hook's internal classification maps these
constitution paths to registration actions:

| Changed path in constitution | Registration action |
|---|---|
| `skills/speckit-*` | Symlink into `<project>/.claude/skills/` |
| `plugins/helix/commands/speckit-*` | Regenerate per-agent slash commands |
| `scripts/speckit/*` | Validate `bash -n` + `sh -n` per §11.4.67 |
| `actions/registry.yaml` (new actions) | Regenerate the `generated/` prefix-command manifests |
| `mcp/speckit-*.json` | `jq`-merge into `<project>/.mcp.json` |

### Detection flow

```bash
# Inside post_update_hook.sh (simplified):
detect_changes() {
  git -C "$CONST_DIR" diff --name-only ORIG_HEAD..HEAD 2>/dev/null || \
    git -C "$CONST_DIR" diff --name-only HEAD~1..HEAD
}

# When a changed path matches skills/speckit-*
install_skill() {
  local skill_dir="$1"
  local skill_name
  skill_name="$(basename "$skill_dir")"
  local target="$PROJECT_ROOT/.claude/skills/$skill_name"

  if [[ -d "$target" ]] && [[ ! -L "$target" ]]; then
    echo "WARNING: $target is a directory, not a symlink — left untouched (§11.4.122)"
    return 0
  fi

  ln -sf "$CONST_DIR/$skill_dir/SKILL.md" "$target"
  echo "  ✓ Registered skill: $skill_name"
}
```

### The hook is idempotent

Running `post_update_hook.sh` multiple times is safe: symlinks are refreshed,
directories are never deleted, commands are regenerated from the current
registry. A missing `claude` CLI is reported honestly (the exact one-time
commands to run are printed); every other agent's wiring proceeds independently.

## §9. Constitutional Mandates Binding the Bridge

This table is the authoritative cross-reference: every constitution §-letter
that binds the SpecKit-Superpowers Bridge, and what compliance means for the
bridge implementation.

## §10. Governance File Amendments

This section enumerates EXACTLY what must be added to each governance file in
the constitution submodule. Following the 5-carrier lockstep rule (§11.4.157),
every addition propagates to all five mirrors in the same commit.

### constitution/Constitution.md

**Add to the Table of Contents** (insert in numerical order):

```markdown
- [§11.4.NNB — SpecKit-Superpowers Bridge lifecycle](#114nnb-speckit-superpowers-bridge-lifecycle)
```

**Add the full anchor text** (from §2 of this document, §2 "Anchor text" subsection,
verbatim), inserted in numerical order among the §11.4 family.

**Add the recommended gate contract**:

```markdown
**CM-COVENANT-114-NNB-PROPAGATION** (literal `11.4.NNB`, block-start shaped per
§11.4.227(B), exactly ONCE per governance file across all 5 mirrors per §11.4.157)
+ recommended gates `CM-SPECKIT-BRIDGE-SKILLS-PRESENT`
/ `CM-SPECKIT-BRIDGE-AUTO-DISCOVERY`
/ `CM-SPECKIT-BRIDGE-TDD-WIRED`
/ `CM-SPECKIT-BRIDGE-NANO-DECOUPLING`
/ `CM-SPECKIT-BRIDGE-CATALOGUE-REGISTERED`
/ `CM-SPECKIT-BRIDGE-CONSUMER-CONFIG`
+ paired §1.1 meta-test mutations (gate-code = separate work item).
```

### constitution/CLAUDE.md

Add to the "Critical base rules restated" section, in the existing alphabetical
anchor order:

```markdown
### SpecKit-Superpowers Bridge lifecycle (§11.4.NNB)

The SpecKit-Superpowers Bridge is a core constitution technology stack —
specify→plan→tasks→implement→review lifecycle with decoupled nano-task
subagent execution and full TDD coverage. Every governed project inherits
it automatically; no per-project installation beyond
`post_update_hook.sh` is required. The bridge mechanizes what the
constitution mandates as prose: every task ships RED-first, every closure
lands four-layer test coverage, and every stage produces captured physical
evidence per §11.4.5/§11.4.69/§11.4.107.
```

### constitution/AGENTS.md

Add the identical text from CLAUDE.md above, in the same position. The
five-carrier lockstep rule (§11.4.157) requires byte-identical content
across all mirrors. The propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-NNB-PROPAGATION`
validates this at the block-start level.

### constitution/QWEN.md

Add the identical text. Same constraints as CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md.

### constitution/GEMINI.md

Add the identical text. Same constraints as all other mirrors.

### Block-start verification

After adding the amendment, verify that the propagation gate's block-start
pattern matches exactly ONCE per file:

```bash
for f in constitution/{Constitution,CLAUDE,AGENTS,QWEN,GEMINI}.md; do
  count=$(grep -c '^### .*SpecKit-Superpowers.*11\.4\.NNB' "$f" || true)
  if [[ "$count" -ne 1 ]]; then
    echo "BLOCK-INTEGRITY FAIL: $f has $count block(s), expected exactly 1"
  fi
done
```

This check will become the `CM-ANCHOR-BLOCK-INTEGRITY` gate per §11.4.227(B).

---

## §11. Catalogue Registration

### Entry to add to constitution/submodules-catalogue.md

Under the **AI / Agent Tooling** section (or a new **Development Lifecycle**
section), add:

```markdown
### Development Lifecycle

- **[`speckit-bridge`](https://github.com/HelixDevelopment/speckit-bridge)** —
  SpecKit→Superpowers lifecycle bridge: specify→plan→tasks→implement→review
  pipeline with constitutional TDD, nano-task decoupling, subagent-driven
  execution, and full physical-evidence anti-bluff coverage at every stage.
  Inherited from the constitution submodule (§11.4.NNB). Consumed by reference
  (never copied) per §11.4.28.
```

If a dedicated organization repo is created (e.g., `HelixDevelopment/speckit-bridge`
or `vasic-digital/speckit-bridge`), update the URL. If the bridge lives
entirely in the constitution submodule (under `scripts/speckit/` and
`skills/speckit-*/`), the catalogue entry points at the constitution repo
itself with a path qualifier:

```markdown
- **[`speckit-bridge`](https://github.com/HelixDevelopment/helix_constitution/tree/main/scripts/speckit)** —
  ...
```

### helix-deps.yaml

The bridge ships a `helix-deps.yaml` in the constitution root (if it carries
own-org dependencies) per §11.4.31:

```yaml
name: speckit-bridge
version: "1.0.0"
dependencies:
  - name: "workable-items"
    ssh_url: "git@github.com:HelixDevelopment/helix_constitution.git"
    ref: "v1.0.0"
    why: "SQLite workable-items DB for tracking bridge-produced tasks"
    layout: flat
  - name: "docs_chain"
    ssh_url: "git@github.com:vasic-digital/docs_chain.git"
    ref: "main"
    why: "Document export synchronization for spec/plan/tasks artifacts"
    layout: flat
```

---

## §12. Validation & Verification

### Pre-build gate integration

The bridge's pre-build gate (`CM-SPECKIT-BRIDGE-SKILLS-PRESENT`) is wired into
the consuming project's `pre_build_verification.sh` under a new section (e.g.,
`DN-SPECKIT` or `DO-SPECKIT` depending on the next available letter pair). The
gate asserts:

1. All 8 bridge skill directories exist under `constitution/skills/speckit-*`
2. Each contains a `SKILL.md` with the `---` frontmatter block and required
   `name:` + `description:` field
3. Each `SKILL.md` parses clean (all multi-line strings balanced, no truncated YAML)
4. The bridge orchestrator script exists at `constitution/scripts/speckit/bridge_lifecycle.sh`
   and is executable
5. The script passes `bash -n` AND `sh -n` parse checks (§11.4.67)

### Paired meta-test mutation

The mutation test temporarily:

1. Renames `SKILL.md` → `SKILL.md.bak` in one skill directory → gate MUST FAIL
2. Strips the `name:` line from a frontmatter block → gate MUST FAIL
3. Injects a bash-only `>(...)` construct without `eval` wrapping → parse gate
   MUST FAIL
4. Restores → gate MUST PASS

The mutation test is registered in `meta_test_false_positive_proof.sh` under
the bridge's section.

### End-to-end consumer validation

A HelixQA Challenge (`CHALLENGE-SPECKIT-001`) validates the full consumer path:

1. **Setup** — a consumer project with the constitution submodule at a pinned
   commit containing the bridge anchor
2. **Onboard** — run `post_update_hook.sh` and verify all 8 skills are
   symlinked
3. **Specify** — issue `/speckit.specify` with a feature description, verify
   `spec.md` is produced with revision header + ≥40-char descriptions
4. **Plan** — run `/speckit.plan`, verify `plan.md` cites research references
5. **Tasks** — run `/speckit.tasks`, verify `tasks.md` contains nano-tasks
   with dependency edges
6. **Implement** — run `/speckit.implement`, verify subagents complete with
   captured evidence
7. **Anti-bluff** — verify every PASS verdict carries an evidence path
   (§11.4.69 `ab_pass_with_evidence`), verify no metadata-only PASS exists

The Challenge is registered in `tools/helixqa/banks/atmosphere.yaml` (or its
project-equivalent).

### Self-validation (golden-good / golden-bad)

Per §11.4.107(10), every bridge analyzer ships:

- **Golden-good fixture** — a valid `spec.md`+`plan.md`+`tasks.md` triplet
  that MUST PASS the consistency analysis
- **Golden-bad fixture** — a triplet with a spec-task that has no
  corresponding plan section; analysis MUST FAIL and pinpoint the orphan
- **Negative-control fixture** — two distinct features with similar-sounding
  subjects that MUST NOT be merged by the dedup analyzer

An analyzer that passes its golden-bad fixture is a bluff and the gate is
itself a defect (§11.4.201).

---

## §13. Implementation Phases
