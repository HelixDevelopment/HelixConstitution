# SOL-08 — tracker scope-coverage gate.
# Corpus 3 measured: ~80% of a workspace's commit volume (≈11,000 of 13,704
# submodule commits, including its single largest repo at 2,790 commits) ran
# UNTRACKED beside an exemplary tracker that held 15 items for all of it.
# No existing anchor checks this axis — every anchor assumes the work IS in the
# tracker's scope. This gate declares the repo set independently (the M2/R3.1
# required-set pattern applied to REPOS) and measures per-repo linkage.
#
# Usage: scope_coverage.sh <workspace-dir> <manifest.tsv> <item-id-ere> <min-pct>
# Exit: 0 clean | 1 findings | 2 blind
